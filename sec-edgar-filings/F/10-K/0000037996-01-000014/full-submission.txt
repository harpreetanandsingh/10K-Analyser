As of February 26, 2001,  Ford had  outstanding  1,764,198,802  shares of Common
Stock  and  70,852,076  shares  of  Class B Stock.  Based on the New York  Stock
Exchange  Composite  Transaction  closing price of the Common Stock on that date
($28.60  a  share),  the  aggregate  market  value  of  such  Common  Stock  was
$50,456,085,737.  Although  there is no  quoted  market  for our  Class B Stock,
shares of Class B Stock  may be  converted  at any time into an equal  number of
shares  of  Common  Stock  for the  purpose  of  effecting  the  sale  or  other
disposition of such shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock and Class
B Stock  outstanding  at February 26, 2000 included  shares owned by persons who
may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Ford. We do not believe,  however,  that any
such person should be considered to be an affiliate.  For information concerning
ownership of outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, see the Proxy Statement
for Ford's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 10, 2001 (our "Proxy
Statement"),  which is  incorporated  by reference  under  various Items of this

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

     Ford Motor  Company was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1919. We acquired the
business of a Michigan company,  also known as Ford Motor Company,  incorporated
in 1903 to produce and sell  automobiles  designed and engineered by Henry Ford.
We are the world's  second-largest  producer of cars and trucks combined. We and
our  subsidiaries  also  engage in other  businesses,  including  financing  and
renting vehicles and equipment.



                                    Overview


     Our business is divided into two business  sectors:  the Automotive  sector
and the  Financial  Services  sector.  We manage these  sectors as three primary
operating segments as described below.

Financial Services:
                        Ford Motor Credit Company          vehicle-related financing, leasing, and insurance

                        The Hertz Corporation              renting and leasing of cars and trucks and
                                                           renting industrial and construction
                                                           equipment, and other activities

</TABLE>

     We provide financial  information (such as, revenues,  income,  and assets)
for each of these business sectors and operating segments in three areas of this
Report:  (1) Item 6. "Selected  Financial Data" on pages 34 through 36; (2) Item
7. "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations"  on pages 37 through  46; and (3) Note 21 of our Notes to  Financial
Statements located at the end of this Report (pages FS-30 and FS-31).  Financial
information  relating  to  certain  geographic  areas  is also  included  in the
above-mentioned areas of this Report.

Item 1.  Business (Continued)
                                Automotive Sector


     We sell cars and trucks  throughout the world. In 2000, we sold 7.4 million
vehicles  throughout  the world.  Our  automotive  vehicle  brands include Ford,
Mercury,  Lincoln,  Volvo,  Jaguar,  Land  Rover,  Aston  Martin and  TH!NK.  In
addition,  we own 33.4% of Mazda Motor Corporation  ("Mazda").  We completed the
purchase of the Land Rover  worldwide  sport  utility  vehicle  business  ("Land
Rover") from the BMW Group on June 30, 2000.  As a result,  our 2000 results and
financial  condition include Land Rover's results and financial  condition since
the date of the acquisition.  In addition,  on June 28, 2000, we distributed 130
million  shares of  Visteon  Corporation  (our  former  automotive  systems  and
components division), which represented our 100% ownership interest, by means of
a tax-free  spin-off in the form of a dividend on Ford Common and Class B Stock.
For the  first  half of  2000,  Visteon  is  included  in  Ford's  results  as a
discontinued  operation.  Beginning  with the third quarter of 2000,  Visteon is
excluded completely from our results and financial condition.

     The worldwide automotive industry, Ford included, is affected significantly
by a number of factors  over which we have  little  control,  including  general
economic  conditions.  In  the  United  States,  the  automotive  industry  is a
highly-competitive,  cyclical  business  that  has a  wide  variety  of  product
offerings.  The  number  of cars and  trucks  sold to  retail  buyers  (commonly
referred to as "industry  demand") can vary  substantially from year to year. In
any year,  industry demand depends largely on general economic  conditions,  the
cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks,  and the availability and cost
of credit and fuel.  Industry demand also reflects the fact that cars and trucks
are durable items that people can wait to replace.

     The  automotive  industry  outside of the United  States  consists  of many
producers,  with no single dominant producer.  Certain  manufacturers,  however,
account for the major  percentage  of total sales within  particular  countries,
especially their countries of origin. Most of the factors that affect the United
States  automotive  industry and its sales volumes and profitability are equally
relevant outside the United States.

     The  worldwide  automotive  industry  also is affected  significantly  by a
substantial amount of costly governmental  regulation.  In the United States and
Europe, for example, governmental regulation has arisen primarily out of concern
for the environment,  for greater vehicle safety, and for improved fuel economy.
Many governments  also regulate local content and/or impose import  requirements
as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, or influencing their
balance of payments.

     Our unit sales vary with the level of total  industry  demand and our share
of that industry  demand.  Our share is  influenced by how our products  compare
with  those  offered by other  manufacturers  based on many  factors,  including
design,  driveability,  price,  quality,  reliability,  safety, and utility. Our
share  also  is  affected  by  our  timing  of  new  model   introductions   and
manufacturing  capacity  limitations.  Our ability to satisfy changing  consumer
preferences  with  respect  to  type  or size of  vehicle  and  its  design  and
performance characteristics can impact our sales and earnings significantly.

                                       2

Item 1.  Business (Continued)


     The  profitability of vehicle sales is affected by many factors,  including
     the following:

     o unit sales volume
     o the mix of vehicles and options sold
     o the margin of profit on each vehicle sold
     o the level of "incentives" (price discounts) and other marketing costs
     o the costs for customer  warranty  claims and other customer  satisfaction
       actions
     o the costs  for  government-mandated  safety,  emission  and fuel  economy
       technology and equipment
     o the ability to manage costs
     o the ability to recover cost increases through higher prices

Further,  because the automotive industry is capital intensive, it operates with
a relatively high percentage of fixed costs  (including  relatively  fixed labor
costs),  which can result in large  changes in earnings  from  relatively  small
changes in unit volume.

     Following  is a  discussion  of the  automotive  industry in the  principal
markets  where we compete,  as well as a discussion of our  Automotive  Consumer
Services Group and our ConsumerConnect e-commerce initiatives and strategy:

     We classify cars by small,  middle, large and luxury segments and trucks by
compact   pickup,   compact   bus/van/utility,   full-size   pickup,   full-size
bus/van/utility and medium/heavy segments. The large and luxury car segments and
the compact  bus/van/utility,  full-size  pickup and  full-size  bus/van/utility
truck segments  include the industry's most profitable  vehicle lines.  The term
"bus" as used in this  discussion  refers to vans designed to carry  passengers.

*In 1997 Ford sold its heavy truck businesses in North America and Australia/New
Zealand to Freightliner  Corporation.  Ford ceased production of heavy trucks in
North  America  in  December  1997.  The  transfer  of the  North  American  and
Australian heavy truck businesses was completed in 1998.

     As shown in the tables  above,  since 1996 there has been a shift from cars
to trucks for both industry sales and Ford sales. Ford's sales of the middle car
segment  as a  percentage  of its  total  sales has  deteriorated  more than the
general   decline  of  the  industry  sales  in  that  segment  because  of  the
discontinuance   of  certain  product  offerings  in  the  segment  (e.g.,  Ford
Thunderbird and Contour and Mercury Mystique).

*    All U.S. retail sales data are based on publicly available information from
     the media and trade publications.
**   Ford purchased Volvo Car on March 31, 1999 and Land Rover on June 30, 2000.
     The  figures  shown  here  include  Volvo Car and Land Rover on a pro forma
     basis for the periods prior to their acquisition by Ford. During the period
     from 1996 through 1998,  Volvo Car  represented no more than 1.2 percentage
     points of total market  share  during any one year.  During the period 1996
     through 1999, Land Rover  represented no more than 0.4 percentage points of
     total market share during any one year.
***  Chrysler  and  Daimler-Benz  merged in late 1998.  The  figures  shown here
     combine  Chrysler and  Daimler-Benz  (excluding  Freightliner  and Sterling
     Heavy Trucks) on a pro forma basis for the periods prior to their merger.
**** "All  Other"  includes  primarily   companies  based  in  various  European
     countries, Korea and other Japanese manufacturers. The increase in combined
     market share shown for "All Others" reflects primarily  increases in market
     share for the Korean manufacturers.
*****"All  Other" in the U.S.  Truck  Market  Shares  table  includes  primarily
     companies  based in various  European  countries,  Korea and other Japanese
     manufacturers. The increase in combined market share shown for "All Others"
     in this table  reflects  primarily  increases in market share for Mazda and
     Mitsubishi.

     The decline in car market share for Ford in 2000 is primarily the result of
the  discontinuance of the Contour and Mystique  products.  The decline in truck
market  share for Ford  since 1997 is  primarily  the result of recent new truck
offerings  by  competitors  and  capacity  constraints  with  respect to certain
components due to stong demand.

     Marketing  Incentives and Fleet Sales.  Automotive  manufacturers that sell
vehicles in the United States typically give purchasers price discounts or other
marketing  incentives.  These  incentives are the result of competition from new
product offerings by manufacturers and the desire to maintain  production levels
and market  shares.  Manufacturers  provide these  incentives to both retail and
fleet customers (fleet

                                       5

customers  include daily rental companies,  commercial fleet customers,  leasing
companies and  governments).  Marketing  incentives  generally are higher during
periods of economic  downturns,  when excess  capacity in the industry  tends to
increase.

     Our  marketing  costs in the United  States as a percentage  of gross sales
revenue were as follows for the  following  three  years:  11.1%  (2000),  10.6%
(1999),  and  10.4%  (1998).  These  "marketing  costs"  include  primarily  (i)
marketing  incentives on vehicles,  such as retail rebates and costs for special
financing and lease programs,  (ii) reserves for costs and/or losses  associated
with our required repurchase of certain vehicles sold to daily rental companies,
and (iii) costs for advertising and sales promotions for vehicles.  The increase
in  marketing  costs  over  the  last  several  years  is a  result  of  intense
competition in the United States market.

     Fleet sales generally are less  profitable than retail sales,  and sales to
daily rental  companies  generally are less profitable than sales to other fleet
purchasers.  The mix between  sales to daily  rental  companies  and other fleet
customers has been about evenly split in recent years. The table below shows our
fleet sales in the United States,  and the amount of those sales as a percentage
of our total United States car and truck sales, for the last five years.

     Warranty  Coverage.  We presently  provide warranty coverage for defects in
factory-supplied  materials and  workmanship on all vehicles  (other than medium
trucks) in the United States.  This warranty coverage for Ford/Mercury  vehicles
extends  for 36 months or 36,000  miles  (whichever  occurs  first)  and  covers
components of the vehicle,  including tires  beginning  January 1, 2001 for 2001
and later model years. Prior to January 1, 2001 tires were warranted only by the
tire  manufacturers.  The United States  warranty  coverage for luxury  vehicles
(Lincoln,  Jaguar,  Volvo, and Land Rover) extends for 48 months or 50,000 miles
(whichever occurs first) but, except for Lincoln beginning January 1, 2001, does
not include tires,  which are warranted by the tire  manufacturers.  In general,
different  warranty coverage is provided on medium/heavy  trucks and on vehicles
sold  outside  the  United  States.  In  addition,   as  discussed  below  under
"Governmental  Standards - Mobile Source Emissions  Control",  the Federal Clean
Air Act requires  warranty  coverage for a "useful  life" of 10 years or 100,000
miles  (whichever  occurs  first)  for  emissions  equipment  on most light duty
vehicles  sold in the United  States.  As a result of these  warranties  and the
increased  concern  for  customer  satisfaction,  costs  for  warranty  repairs,
emissions  equipment  repairs,  and  customer  satisfaction  actions  ("warranty
costs") can be substantial. Estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us
are  accrued  at the  time of sale.  Such  accruals,  however,  are  subject  to
adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience.

Europe
- ------

     Outside of the United States,  Europe is our largest market for the sale of
cars and trucks.  The  automotive  industry in Europe is intensely  competitive.
Over the past year,  140 new or freshened  vehicles,  including  derivatives  of
existing   vehicles,   were   introduced  in  the  European  market  by  various
manufacturers.  For the  past 14  years,  the top six  manufacturers  have  each
achieved  a car  market  share in about  the 10% to 18%  range.  (Manufacturers'
shares,  however, vary considerably by country.) This competitive environment is
expected to intensify  further as Japanese  manufacturers,  which together had a
European car market share of 11.4% for 2000,  increase their production capacity
in Europe. We estimate that in 2000 the European  automotive industry had excess
capacity of  approximately  6 million  units (based on a comparison  of European
domestic demand and capacity).

     In 2000,  vehicle  manufacturers  sold  approximately 17.8 million cars and
trucks in Europe,  down 2% from 1999  levels.  Our combined car and truck market
share in Europe in 2000 was 10.0%, down 2/10 of one percentage point from 1999.

                                       6

Item 1.  Business (Continued)


     Britain and Germany are our most important markets within Europe,  although
the Southern  European  countries  are becoming  increasingly  significant.  Any
adverse  change in the British or German market has a significant  effect on our
total automotive profits. For 2000 compared with 1999, total industry sales were
up 1% in Britain and down 10% in Germany.

     For  purposes  of the figures  shown in this  section,  we have  considered
Europe to consist of the following 19 markets:  Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands,  Portugal, Switzerland,  Finland,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, and Poland.

Other Markets
- -------------

     Mexico and Canada.  Mexico and Canada also are important markets for us. In
2000, industry sales of new cars and trucks in Mexico were approximately 886,000
units, up 28% from 1999 levels. In Canada, industry sales of new cars and trucks
in 2000 were  approximately  1.59 million  units,  up 3% from 1999  levels.  Our
combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2000 was 16.2%  (Mexico)
and 17.8% (Canada).

     South  America.  Brazil and Argentina  are our  principal  markets in South
America. The economic environment in those countries has been volatile in recent
years,  leading to large  variations in industry  sales.  Results have also been
influenced by the devaluation of the Brazilian currency, continued weak economic
conditions  and  government  actions to reduce  inflation  and public  deficits.
Industry  sales in 2000 were 1.45  million  units in  Brazil,  up about 16% from
1999, and approximately  307,000 units in Argentina,  down 19% from 1999. Brazil
shows signs of continued  economic  recovery and we expect  industry  volumes to
improve further in 2001.  Economic  conditions  remain weak in Argentina,  which
could lead to further  deterioration  of industry  volumes in 2001. Our combined
car and truck market share in these  markets in 2000 was 9.1% (Brazil) and 14.9%
(Argentina).

     Ford has undertaken  restructuring  actions in recent years to reduce costs
and improve our competitiveness in South America. In addition, we are building a
new assembly  plant in Brazil,  which will  manufacture a new family of vehicles
for the South  America  markets.  The new plant will start  building the Courier
this fall and begin producing an all-new vehicle next year.

     Asia Pacific. In the Asia Pacific region,  Australia,  Taiwan and Japan are
our principal markets.  Industry volumes in 2000 in this region were as follows:
approximately  788,000  units in  Australia  (up 0.1% from 1999),  approximately
420,000 units in Taiwan (down 1% from 1999) and approximately 6 million units in
Japan (up 1.7% from 1999).  In 2000,  our combined car and truck market share in
Australia was 15.4%. In Taiwan,  we had a combined car and truck market share in
2000 of 12.3%.  Our  combined  car and truck market share in Japan has been less
than 1% in recent years.  We own a 33.4% interest in Mazda and account for Mazda
on an equity basis.  Mazda's market share in Japan has been in the 5 to 6% range
in recent years.  Our principal  competition in the Asia Pacific region has been
the Japanese  manufacturers.  We anticipate  that the  continuing  relaxation of
import  restrictions  (including  duty  reductions) in Australia and Taiwan will
intensify competition in those markets.

     We opened a new assembly plant in India in 1999, launching an all-new small
car (the Ikon) designed  specifically  for that market.  In 2000,  approximately
17,000 Ikons were produced for sale in India. In addition,  India commenced sale
of Ikon CKD (completely knocked down) kits to Mexico and South Africa. We expect
India to become one of our most important markets in Asia in the future.

     Africa.  In recent years, we have operated in the South African market as a
45% owner in the South African Motor Corporation (Pty.) Limited  ("SAMCOR").  In
2000, we increased our  ownership  interest in SAMCOR to 100% by purchasing  the
remaining 55% we did not previously own.  Subsequent to this purchase,  SAMCOR's
name was changed to Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa ("FMCSA").

Item 1.  Business (Continued)


     FMCSA assembles and distributes Ford, Mazda,  Mitsubishi and,  beginning in
2000,  Volvo vehicles in South Africa.  In addition,  FMCSA  distributes  Jaguar
vehicles.  In 2000,  industry volume in South Africa was  approximately  341,000
units, up 15% from 1999 levels.  FMCSA's  combined car and truck market share in
2000 was 15.5% for the five brands it distributes; the share for the Ford brands
(Ford, Mazda, Volvo and Jaguar) was 14.6%.

outside the Ford network of service providers.

     Automotive  Consumer  Services Group conducts business in over 40 countries
and serves consumers through over 13,000 dealer outlets and over 2,500 all-makes

ConsumerConnect
- ---------------

      ConsumerConnect is a business  unit  within  Ford  dedicated  to  building
e-business  platforms across Ford which  revolutionize  core business  processes
within Ford globally and provide the consumer an enhanced purchase and ownership
experience.

     In 2000,  ConsumerConnect  was  involved in the  creation of several  joint
ventures. In the B2C (Business-to-Consumer)  arena,  ConsumerConnect established
DealerDirect LLC which conducts business under the name FordDirect.com.  This is
the first  e-commerce  joint venture between an automotive  manufacturer and its
dealer body, and it will provide consumers with an improved internet  experience
in buying and owning a Ford vehicle.  Ford owns 93% of the economic  interest in
DelaerDirect  LLC and 20% of the general  voting power.  In the Mobile  Commerce
(M-commerce) arena, ConsumerConnect launched Wingcast, LLC, a joint venture with
Qualcomm,  Incorporated dedicated to providing wireless, digital information and
entertainment services to consumers in their cars and trucks.  Percepta,  LLC, a
joint venture with TeleTech  Holdings,  Inc. that provides leading edge customer
relationship management services, was launched in 2000 as well. Ford's ownership
interests in Wingcast and Percepta are 80% and 45%, respectively.

     Finally,  in the  B2B  (Business-to-Business)  arena,  ConsumerConnect  was
instrumental in launching Covisint, LLC -- a business-to-business Internet based
supplier exchange. Covisint will streamline the automotive industry supply chain
by providing  efficiencies to manufacturers  and suppliers in almost every stage
of the order-to-delivery  process.  Covisint was founded by Ford, General Motors
Corporation,  DaimlerChrysler  AG, Renault S.A. and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.. Each
of  these  founding  automotive  manufacturers  has  an  ownership  interest  in
Covisint,  and Oracle  Corporation  and Commerce  One,  Inc. are the  technology
partners. Ford's ownership interest in Covisint is approximately 31%.

     Ford Credit relies heavily on its ability to raise  substantial  amounts of
funds. These funds are obtained primarily by the issuance of term debt, the sale
of commercial  paper,  and, in the case of Ford Credit  Europe,  the issuance of
certificates of deposit.  Funds also are provided by retained earnings and sales
of receivables.  The level of funds can be affected by certain transactions with
Ford,  such as capital  contributions,  interest  supplements  and other support
costs  from  Ford  for  vehicles  financed  and  leased  by  Ford  Credit  under
Ford-sponsored  special  financing or leasing  programs, and dividend  payments.
Funds  also can be  affected  by the timing of  payments  for the  financing  of
dealers' wholesale inventories and for income taxes.

     The ability of Ford Credit to obtain funds is affected by its debt ratings,
which are closely  related to the outlook for, and financial  condition of, Ford
and the nature and availability of support facilities. The long-term senior debt
of each of Ford,  Ford Credit and Ford  Credit  Europe is rated "A2" (by Moody's
Investors  Service) and "A" (by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group). The commercial
paper of each of Ford Credit and FCE Bank is rated  "Prime-1"  (by  Moody's),
"A-1" (by S&P), and "F1" (by Fitch, Inc.).

     For a  discussion  of how Ford  Credit  manages  its and its  subsidiaries'
credit risk, lease residual risks,  financial market risks, and liquidity risks,
see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk".

     Under a profit maintenance  agreement with Ford Credit,  Ford has agreed to
make payments to maintain Ford Credit's earnings at certain levels. In addition,
under a support  agreement  with Ford Credit  Europe,  Ford Credit has agreed to
maintain Ford Credit  Europe's net worth above a minimum level. No payments were
required under either of these agreements during the period 1988 through 2000.

- ---------------------

     Hertz and its  affiliates  and  independent  licensees  operate  what Hertz
believes is the largest  car rental  business in the world based upon  revenues.
They also  operate  one of the largest  industrial  and  construction  equipment
rental  businesses  in  North  America  based  upon  revenues.   Hertz  and  its
affiliates, associates and independent licensees, do the following:

     o rent and lease cars and trucks
     o rent industrial and construction equipment
     o sell their used cars and equipment
     o provide third-party claim management services
     o provide telecommunications services

These businesses are operated from approximately 7,000 locations  throughout the
United States and in over 140 foreign countries and jurisdictions.

     Below are some financial highlights for Hertz (in millions):

     Between  April  1997 and  March  2001,  we owned  approximately  81% of the
economic interest of Hertz, with the remaining 19% interest being represented by
shares of Hertz common stock that were publicly traded. In March 2001, through a
cash tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired the publicly held shares
and, as a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford.

                             Governmental Standards

     A number of  governmental  standards  and  regulations  relating to safety,
corporate  average fuel economy  ("CAFE"),  emissions  control,  noise  control,
damageability,  and theft  prevention  are  applicable  to new  motor  vehicles,
engines,  and equipment  manufactured for sale in the United States,  Europe and
elsewhere.  In addition,  manufacturing  and assembly  facilities  in the United
States,  Europe and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards  regulating air
emissions,  water  discharges,  and  the  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous
substances.  Such facilities in the United States and Europe also are subject to
comprehensive national,  regional,  and/or local permit programs with respect to
such matters.

     Mobile Source Emissions Control - U.S. Requirements.  The Federal Clean Air
Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully
may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United
States.  Currently,  most light duty  vehicles  sold in the United  States  must
comply  with these  standards  for 10 years or 100,000  miles,  whichever  first
occurs.   The  U.S.   Environmental   Protection  Agency  ("EPA")  recently  has
promulgated  post-2004  model year  standards  that are more  stringent than the
default  standards  contained in the Clean Air Act. These new  regulations  will
require most light duty trucks to meet the same emissions standards as passenger
cars by the 2007 model year.  The stringency of the new standards may impact our
ability to produce and offer a broad range of products with the  characteristics
and functionality  that customers  demand.  The new standards also are likely to
limit severely the use of diesel technology,  which could negatively impact fuel
economy performance.  The EPA has also promulgated  post-2004 emission standards
for  "heavy-duty"  trucks  (8,500-14,000  lbs.  gross  vehicle  weight).   These
standards are likely to pose technical challenges and may affect the competitive
position of full-line vehicle manufacturers such as Ford.

     Pursuant to the Clean Air Act,  California  has  received a waiver from the
EPA to establish its own unique emissions  control  standards.  New vehicles and
engines sold in  California  must be certified by the  California  Air Resources
Board ("CARB").  CARB's emissions  requirements  (the "California  program") for
model  years 1994  through  2003  require  manufacturers  to meet a  non-methane
organic gases fleet average  requirement  that is  significantly  more stringent
than that prescribed by the Clean Air Act for the corresponding periods of time.
In late 1998, CARB adopted stringent new vehicle  emissions  standards that must
be phased in beginning in the 2004 model year.  These new  standards  treat most
light duty trucks the same as passenger  cars and require both types of vehicles
to meet new stringent emissions requirements. It is also expected that these new
standards will essentially  eliminate the use of diesel  technology.  CARB's new
standards present a difficult engineering and technological  challenge,  and may
impact our  ability  to produce  and offer a broad  range of  products  with the
characteristics and functionality that customers demand.

     Since  1990,  the  California   program  has  included   requirements   for
manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale "zero-emission vehicles" ("the ZEV
mandate").  The ZEV mandate  initially  required that a specified  percentage of
each manufacturer's vehicles produced for sale in California, beginning at 2% in
1998 and increasing to 10% in 2003,  must be  zero-emission  vehicles  ("ZEVs"),
which produce no emissions of regulated pollutants. In 1996, CARB eliminated the
ZEV mandate for the  1998-2002  model  years,  but retained the 10% mandate in a
modified form beginning with the 2003 model year. Around the same time,  vehicle
manufacturers  voluntarily  entered  into  agreements  with CARB to conduct  ZEV
demonstration programs.

     In January 2001, CARB voted to approve a series of complex modifications to
the ZEV mandate. These modifications require large-volume  manufacturers such as
Ford to produce "partial zero-emission vehicles" ("PZEVs") and/or ZEVs beginning
in  the  2003  model  year.   PZEVs  are  vehicles   certified  to  California's
"super-ultra-low  emission  vehicle"  ("SULEV")  tailpipe  standards,  with zero
evaporative emissions. Using a series of phase-in tables and credit adjustments,
the  number  of  ZEVs  required   under  the  modified   mandate  will  increase
substantially between 2003 and 2018.

     The Clean Air Act permits  other states that do not meet  national  ambient
air quality standards to adopt  California's motor vehicle emission standards no
later than two years before the affected  model year.  New York,  Massachusetts,
Vermont,  and Maine adopted the  California  standards  effective  with the

                                       13

Item 1.  Business (Continued)


2001 model year or before.  New York,  Massachusetts,  and  Vermont  have either
previously  adopted,  or indicated an intention  to adopt,  the  California  ZEV
mandate;  however,  at this  writing it is not clear  whether  these states will
adopt the ZEV  regulations  as modified by California in 2001.  Maryland and New
Jersey have laws  requiring  the  adoption of  California  standards  if certain
triggers are met. There are problems with transferring  California  standards to
northeast  states,  including  the  following:  1) the driving  range of ZEVs is
greatly diminished in cold weather, thereby limiting their market appeal; and 2)
the northeast states have refused to adopt the California  reformulated gasoline
regulations,  which may impair  the  ability of  vehicles  to meet  California's
in-use standards.

     Battery electric  vehicles are the only  zero-emission  vehicles  currently
feasible for mass production.  Despite intensive  research  activities,  battery
technology  has not made the  major  strides  that were  projected  when the ZEV
mandate  was  originally  enacted  in  1990.  Battery-electric  vehicles  remain
considerably  more  costly  than  gasoline-powered  vehicles,  and  they  have a
relatively  short  driving  range before they must be  recharged.  These factors
limit the consumer appeal of battery-powered vehicles. Ford plans to comply with
the early years of the modified ZEV mandate  through sales of its Th!nk brand of
electric  vehicles,  along with one or more PZEV  models.  In the  longer  term,
however,  it is doubtful  whether the market will  support the number of battery
electric  vehicles called for by the modified ZEV mandate.  Fuel cell technology
may in the future enable production of ZEVs with widespread consumer appeal, but
commercially  feasible fuel cell technology appears to be a decade or more away.
Compliance with the ZEV mandate may eventually require costly actions that would
have a  substantial  adverse  effect on Ford's  sales  volume and  profits.  For
example,  we could be  required  to curtail  the sale of  non-electric  vehicles
and/or offer to sell electric vehicles well below cost. Other states may seek to
adopt the ZEV  mandate  pursuant  to Section  177 of the Clean air Act,  thereby
increasing the costs to Ford.

     Under the  Clean Air Act,  the EPA and CARB can  require  manufacturers  to
recall and repair  non-conforming  vehicles.  The EPA,  through  its  testing of
production vehicles, also can halt the shipment of non-conforming vehicles. Ford
may be required to recall, or may voluntarily recall, vehicles for such purposes
in the future. The costs of related repairs or inspections  associated with such
recalls can be substantial.

     European  Requirements.   European  Union  ("EU")  directives  and  related
legislation limit the amount of regulated  pollutants that may be emitted by new
motor  vehicles  and  engines  sold in the EU.  In 1998,  the EU  adopted  a new
directive on emissions  from passenger cars and light  commercial  trucks.  More
stringent emissions standards apply to new car certifications  beginning January
1, 2000 and to new car  registrations  beginning  January  1, 2001  ("Stage  III
Standards"). A second level of even more stringent emission standards will apply
to new car certifications beginning January 1, 2005 and to new car registrations
beginning  January  1,  2006  ("Stage  IV  Standards").   The  comparable  light
commercial  truck Stage III  Standards  and Stage IV  Standards  would come into
effect  one year  later  than the  passenger  car  requirements.  The  directive
includes  a  framework  that  permits  EU  member  states  to  introduce  fiscal
incentives  to  promote  early  compliance  with  the  Stage  III and  Stage  IV
Standards. The directive also introduces on-board diagnostic requirements,  more
stringent evaporative emission  requirements,  and in-service compliance testing
and recall provisions for emissions-related defects that occur in the first five
years or 80,000  kilometers of vehicle life  (extended to 100,000  kilometers in
2005).  The  Stage IV  Standards  for  diesel  engines  are not yet  technically
feasible  and may impact  our  ability  to  produce  and offer a broad  range of
products with the  characteristics  and  functionality  that  customers  want. A
related EU directive  was adopted at the same time which  establishes  standards
for cleaner fuels  beginning in 2000 and even cleaner  fuels in 2005.  The EU is
setting up a program to assess the need for further changes to vehicle  emission
and fuel standards after 2005.

     Certain  European  countries are  conducting  in-use  emissions  testing to
ascertain  compliance of motor  vehicles with  applicable  emissions  standards.
These  actions  could lead to recalls of  vehicles;  the future costs of related
inspection or repairs could be substantial.

     Motor Vehicle Safety - The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of
1966 (the "Safety Act") regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle  equipment in
two primary ways.  First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States
of any new  vehicle  or  equipment  that does not  conform to  applicable  motor
vehicle  safety  standards  established by the National  Highway  Traffic Safety
Administration (the "Safety

                                       14

Item 1.  Business (Continued)


Administration").  Meeting or exceeding many safety  standards is costly because
the standards  tend to conflict with the need to reduce  vehicle weight in order
to meet emissions and fuel economy  standards.  Second,  the Safety Act requires
that defects  related to motor vehicle safety be remedied  through safety recall
campaigns. There were pending before the Safety Administration  approximately 30
investigations  relating  to  alleged  safety  defects  in Ford  vehicles  as of
February 7, 2001. A  manufacturer  also is  obligated  to recall  vehicles if it
determines  that they do not comply with a safety  standard.  Should Ford or the
Safety  Administration  determine that either a safety defect or a noncompliance
exists  with  respect to certain of Ford's  vehicles,  the costs of such  recall
campaigns could be substantial.

     The Transportation  Recall Enhancement,  Accountability,  and Documentation
Act (the  "TREAD  Act") was  signed  into law in  November  2000.  The TREAD Act
establishes  new  reporting  requirements  for  motor  vehicles,  motor  vehicle
equipment,   and  tires,   including  reporting  to  the  Safety  Administration
information on foreign recalls and information received by the manufacturer that
may assist the agency in the identification of safety defects. The obligation of
vehicle  manufacturers  to provide,  on a cost-free basis, a remedy for vehicles
with an identified safety defect or non-compliance  issue is extended from eight
years to ten years by the new  legislation.  The Safety  Administration  is also
required  to develop a new dynamic  test on  rollovers  to be used for  consumer
information.  Potential  civil penalties are increased from $1,000 to $5,000 per
day for certain statutory violations,  with a maximum penalty of $15,000,000 for
a related series of violations.  Similar penalties are included for violation of
the reporting  requirements.  Criminal  penalties are introduced for persons who
make false statements to the government or withhold  information with the intent
to mislead the government about safety defects that have caused death or serious
bodily injury.

     Canada,  the EU,  individual  member  countries  within  the EU,  and other
countries in Europe, South America and the Asia Pacific markets also have safety
standards  applicable  to motor  vehicles and are likely to adopt  additional or
more stringent standards in the future.

     Motor  Vehicle Fuel Economy - U.S.  Requirements.  Under 49 U.S.C.  Chapter
329,  vehicles  must  meet  minimum  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  ("CAFE")
standards  set by the  Safety  Administration.  A  manufacturer  is  subject  to
potentially substantial civil penalties if it fails to meet the CAFE standard in
any model  year,  after  taking  into  account  all  available  credits  for the
preceding three model years and expected  credits for the three succeeding model
years.

     The law  established a passenger car CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg for 1985 and
later model years, which the Safety Administration believes it has the authority
to amend to a level it determines to be the maximum  feasible level.  The Safety
Administration  has  established  a 20.7 mpg CAFE  standard  applicable to light
trucks.

     Ford expects to be able to comply with the  foregoing  CAFE  standards,  in
some cases using credits from prior or  succeeding  model years.  In general,  a
continued  increase  in demand for larger  vehicles,  coupled  with a decline in
demand for small and middle-size vehicles could jeopardize our long-term ability
to maintain compliance with CAFE standards.

     At the request of Congress,  the National Academy of Sciences  ("NAS"),  in
conjunction with the Department of Transportation  ("DOT"), is studying possible
changes to the CAFE standards and/or regulations.  The NAS study is scheduled to
be completed  by the third  quarter of 2001.  To the extent that NAS  recommends
changes, they will not take effect automatically. Modifications would need to be
implemented either through DOT rulemaking or through amendments to the CAFE law.

     It is  anticipated  that  efforts  may be made to raise  the CAFE  standard
because of concerns for carbon dioxide  ("CO2")  emissions,  energy  security or
other reasons.  Former President  Clinton's  Climate Change Action Plan ("CCAP")
sets a goal to improve new vehicle fuel efficiency in an amount equivalent to at
least  2% per  year  over a 10 to 15 year  period.  In  addition,  international
concerns  over global  warming due to the emission of  "greenhouse  gasses" have
given rise to strong pressures to improve fuel economy  performance.  During the
December  1997  meeting  of the  parties to the United  Nations  Climate  Change
Convention in Kyoto,  Japan,  the United States agreed to reduce  greenhouse gas
emissions by 7% below

                                       15

<PAGE>
Item 1.  Business (Continued)


their 1990 levels during the 2008-2012 period (the "Kyoto Protocol").  The Kyoto
Protocol is not yet binding in the United States,  pending  ratification  by the
Senate. In addition,  a petition has been filed with the EPA requesting that the
Agency  regulate CO2 emissions  from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The
EPA has requested public comment on this petition.

     If the CCAP or Kyoto  Protocol  goals are  partially  or fully  implemented
through increases in the CAFE standard, if significant increases in car or light
truck CAFE standards for subsequent model years otherwise are imposed, or if EPA
attempts to regulate  CO2 from motor  vehicles,  Ford might find it necessary to
take various costly actions that could have  substantial  adverse effects on its
sales volume and profits. For example,  Ford might have to curtail production of
larger  family-size  and  luxury  cars  and  full-size  light  trucks,  restrict
offerings of engines and popular  options,  and increase market support programs
for its most fuel-efficient cars and light trucks.

     Foreign Requirements.  The EU is also a party to the Kyoto Protocol and has
agreed to reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions by 8% below their 1990 levels during
the 2008-2012  period.  In December  1997,  the European  Council of Environment
Ministers (the "Environment  Council") reaffirmed its goal to reduce average CO2
emissions  from new cars to 120 grams per  kilometer by 2010 (at the latest) and
invited  European  motor  vehicle  manufacturers  to negotiate  further with the
European Commission on a satisfactory voluntary  environmental agreement to help
achieve this goal.  In October 1998,  the EU agreed to support an  environmental
agreement with the European Automotive Manufacturers  Association (of which Ford
is  a  member)  on  CO2  emission   reductions  from  new  passenger  cars  (the
"Agreement").  The Agreement  establishes an emission target of 140 grams of CO2
per  kilometer  for the average of new cars sold in the EU by the  Association's
members in 2008. In addition,  the Agreement  provides that certain  Association
members  (including  Ford) will introduce models emitting no more than 120 grams
of CO2 per  kilometer in 2000,  and  establishes  an  estimated  target range of
165-170  grams of CO2 per  kilometer  for the  average of new cars sold in 2003.
Also in 2003,  the  Association  will review the  potential for  additional  CO2
reductions, with a view to moving further toward the EU's objective of 120 grams
of CO2 per kilometer by 2012. The Agreement assumes (among other things) that no
negative measures will be implemented  against  diesel-fueled  cars and the full
availability  of  improved  fuels with low sulfur  content in 2005.  Average CO2
emissions of 140 grams per kilometer for new passenger cars corresponds to a 25%
reduction in average CO2 emissions compared to 1995.

     The Environment Council requested the European Commission to review in 2003
the EU's progress  toward reaching the 120 gram target by 2010, and to implement
annual  monitoring  of the average CO2  emissions  from new  passenger  cars and
progress toward achievement of the objectives for 2000 and 2003.

     In  1995,  members  of  the  German  Automobile  Manufacturers  Association
(including  Ford  Werke  AG) made a  voluntary  pledge to  increase  by 2005 the
average  fuel  economy of new cars sold in Germany by 25% from 1990  levels,  to
make regular reports on fuel consumption,  and to increase industry research and
development  efforts  toward  this  end.  The  German  Automobile  Manufacturers
Association has reported that the industry is on track to meet the pledge.

     Other European countries are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2
emissions  from  motor  vehicles.  Taken  together,  such  proposals  could have
substantial adverse effects on our sales volumes and profits in Europe.

     Japan has adopted automobile fuel consumption goals that manufacturers must
attempt to achieve by the 2000 model year. The consumption  levels apply only to
gasoline-powered  vehicles,  vary by vehicle weight,  and range from 5.8 km/l to
19.2 km/l.

     End-of-Life  Vehicle  Proposal - The European  Parliament  has  published a
Directive  imposing an obligation on motor  vehicle  manufacturers  to take back
end-of-life  vehicles  registered  after  July 1,  2002 with no cost to the last
owner and to take back all other  vehicles as of January 1, 2007.  The Directive
also imposes  requirements on the proportion of the vehicle that may be disposed
of in landfills and the proportion that must be reused or recycled  beginning in
2006, and bans the use of certain substances in vehicles

                                       16

Item 1.  Business (Continued)


beginning  with  vehicles  registered  after July 2003.  Member states may apply
these provisions prior to the dates mentioned  above.  This Directive  imposes a
substantial cost on manufacturers.

     The German Automobile  Association (including Ford Werke AG) and the German
Automobile  Importers  Association  made  a  voluntary  pledge  to  establish  a
nationwide  infrastructure network to take back passenger cars that are at least
12 years old (and meet certain other requirements) on a cost-free basis to their
owners.

     Pollution Control Costs - During the period 2001 through 2005, we expect to
spend  approximately $334 million on our North American and European  facilities
to comply with air and water  pollution and hazardous  waste control  standards,
which now are in effect or are scheduled to come into effect.  Of this total, we
estimate spending approximately $60 million in 2001 and $94 million in 2002.

</TABLE>

     In 2000,  the average  number of people we employed  decreased 7.5 percent.
The  decrease  was due to our  spin-off  of Visteon  Corporation  and its 17,400
salaried employees and 34,800 non-U.S.  hourly employees,  offset partially by a
number  of  acquisitions  during  2000,  notably  Land  Rover,  which  increased
employment  levels by  approximately  6,300  people.  The numbers  above include
approximately  23,000  hourly  employees  of Ford who are  assigned  to  Visteon
Corporation.  These employees worked at Visteon  facilities in the U.S. prior to
the spin-off and, pursuant to our collective  bargaining agreement with the UAW,
remain Ford employees.  Visteon reimburses Ford for all costs to Ford associated
with these employees. Most of our employees work in our Automotive operations.

     For further information  regarding employment  statistics of Ford, see Item
6. "Selected  Financial Data" later in this Report.  For information  concerning
employee retirement benefits, see Note 12 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at the end of this Report.

     Substantially  all of the hourly employees in our Automotive  operations in
the United States are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  Approximately  99%  of  these  unionized  hourly  employees  in our
Automotive segment are represented by the United Automobile Workers (the "UAW").
Approximately  3% of our salaried  employees  are  represented  by unions.  Most
hourly employees and many non-management  salaried employees of our subsidiaries
outside the United States also are represented by unions.

     We have entered into a collective  bargaining  agreement  with the UAW that
will expire on  September  14,  2003.  We also have  entered  into a  collective
bargaining  agreement  with the Canadian  Automobile  Workers  ("CAW") that will
expire on September 21, 2002.  Among other things,  our agreements  with the UAW
and CAW provide for guaranteed  wage and benefit levels  throughout  their terms
and provide for significant employment security.

     We are or will be negotiating  new collective  bargaining  agreements  with
labor unions in Europe, Mexico and South America,  where current agreements will
expire in 2001. A work stoppage  could occur as a result of these  negotiations,
which, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect Ford's profits.

     In  recent  years  we  have  not  had  significant  work  stoppages  at our
facilities,  but they have occurred in some of our  suppliers'  facilities.  Any
protracted  work stoppages in the future,  whether in our facilities or those of
certain  suppliers,   could  substantially   adversely  affect  our  results  of
operations.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

     Various legal actions,  governmental  investigations  and  proceedings  and
claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us and
our subsidiaries,  including those arising out of the following: alleged defects
in our products;  governmental regulations covering safety,  emissions, and fuel
economy; financial services;  employment-related  matters; dealer, supplier, and
other  contractual   relationships;   intellectual   property  rights;   product
warranties; and environmental matters. Some of the pending legal actions are, or
purport to be,  class  actions.  Some of the  foregoing  matters  involve or may
involve compensatory, punitive or antitrust or other multiplied damage claims in
very large amounts, or demands for recall campaigns,  environmental  remediation
programs,  sanctions or other relief which, if granted, would require very large
expenditures. See Item 1,"Business - Governmental Standards". Included among the
foregoing matters are the following:


Firestone Matters
- -----------------

     On August 9, 2000,  Bridgestone/Firestone,  Inc. ("Firestone")  announced a
recall of all  Firestone  ATX and ATX II tires  (P235/75R15)  produced  in North
America  since 1991 and  Wilderness AT tires of that same size  manufactured  at
Firestone's Decatur,  Illinois plant. Firestone estimated that about 6.5 million
of the  affected  tires  were  still  in  service  on the date  the  recall  was
announced.  The recall was announced following an analysis by Ford and Firestone
that  identified  a  statistically  significant  incidence  of tread  separation
occurring in the affected  tires.  Most of the affected  tires were installed as
original  equipment on Ford  Explorer  sport utility  vehicles.  We believe that
sufficient  tires to provide for the  completion of the recall were available by
the end of November 2000.

     The Safety  Administration is investigating this matter both to make a root
cause assessment and to determine whether  Firestone's recall should be expanded
to include other Firestone  tires. We are actively  cooperating  with the Safety
Administration  in their  investigation  by providing  technical  assistance and
sharing engineering analysis and root cause analysis.

     In the United States,  the recall of certain Firestone tires, most of which
were installed as original equipment on Ford Explorers, has led to a significant
number of personal injury and class action lawsuits  against Ford and Firestone.
Plaintiffs in the personal  injury cases  typically  allege that their  injuries
were  caused by defects in the tire that  caused it to lose its tread  and/or by
defects in the  Explorer  that caused the vehicle to roll over.  For those cases
involving Explorer  rollovers in which damages have been specified,  the damages
specified  by the  plaintiffs,  including  both  actual  and  punitive  damages,
aggregated approximately $590 million. However, in most of the actions described
above,  no dollar amount of damages is specified or the specific amount referred
to is only the jurisdictional  minimum. It has been our experience that in cases
that  allege a  specific  amount of  damages  in  excess  of the  jurisdictional
minimum, such amounts, on average, bear little relation to the actual amounts of
damages, if any, paid by Ford in resolving such cases.

     In contrast to the cases described in the preceding paragraph,  most of the
Firestone  related  class  actions have been filed on behalf of persons who have
never been in an  accident.  The class  actions  seek to expand the scope of the
recall to include  other tires and to award to  consumers  the cost of replacing
those tires or the alleged  diminution in the value of the vehicle caused by the
allegedly defective tires or by alleged defects in the Explorer.  Typically, the
plaintiffs  in both the  personal  injury  lawsuits  and the class  actions seek
punitive damages.

     The Company also has been served with shareholder derivative and securities
fraud lawsuits.  The shareholder  derivative  actions filed against the Board of
Directors and the Company allege that the Company's board members breached their
fiduciary duties to the Company and shareholders by failing to inform themselves
adequately  regarding Firestone tires, failing to take certain actions regarding
the design of the Explorer,  failing to report problems with Firestone tires and
to stop using Firestone tires as

                                       20

<PAGE>

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

original equipment, failing to recall all affected tires in a timely manner, and
mismanaging  the recall once it was announced.  The plaintiffs  seek  injunctive
relief and damages, a return of all director  compensation  during the period of
the alleged breaches, and attorneys' fees.

     The securities  fraud class actions allege that from early 1999 through the
announcement of the Firestone tire recall,  Ford made  misrepresentations  about
the safety of Ford products and the Explorer in particular, and allegedly failed
to disclose material facts about problems with Firestone tires and the safety of
Explorers  equipped with Firestone tires. The plaintiffs claim that, as a result
of these misrepresentations or omissions,  they purchased Ford stock at inflated
prices and were  damaged when the price of the stock fell upon  announcement  of
the recall and subsequent revelations.

     Several governmental authorities in Venezuela are conducting investigations
of accidents in Venezuela involving Explorers equipped with Firestone tires most
of  which  were  locally  made.   Ford  of  Venezuela   implemented  a  customer
satisfaction  program in May 2000 to replace all Firestone  Wilderness  tires on
Explorers and light trucks in Venezuela, Columbia and Ecuador. Ford of Venezuela
essentially  completed the tire  replacement  customer  satisfaction  program in
Venezuela in December 2000 and in Colombia and Ecuador in March 2001.

     An investigation  is being conducted by the prosecutor's  office in Caracas
to determine  whether  criminal  charges should be brought against any Firestone
and Ford of  Venezuela  directors,  officers,  and  managers  following a report
submitted  by the  consumer  protection  agency  of the  Venezuelan  government,
INDECU,  to the  Venezuelan  Attorney  General.  The report alleged that several
unsubstantiated  defects  in  the  Explorer  had  contributed  to  the  rollover
accidents  as well as  recommending  an  additional  investigation  because  the
parties had not taken action  sooner.  INDECU also has  indicated it may open an
administrative  proceeding  to determine if fines up to $11,000 per complaint it
has received from consumers  should be levied against  Firestone  and/or Ford of
Venezuela.

     A  committee   of  the   Venezuelan   National   Assembly  or  congress  is
investigating  the  cause  and  handling  of the  Explorer  accidents  caused by
Firestone  tire tread  separation  and has  designated  a  technical  commission
composed primarily of Venezuelan  university  professors to study the causes and
provide a report on their findings.  This  investigation is continuing with full
Ford cooperation.


Other Product Liability Matters
- -------------------------------

     Occupant  Restraint  Systems.  Ford is a defendant  in various  actions for
damages  arising out of automobile  accidents  where the  plaintiffs  claim that
their  injuries  resulted from (or were  aggravated  by) alleged  defects in the
occupant  restraint  systems in vehicle lines of various model years.  For those
cases in which  damages  have  been  specified,  the  damages  specified  by the
plaintiffs, including both actual and punitive damages, aggregated approximately
$603 million at December 31, 2000.

     Bronco  II.  Ford  is a  defendant  in  various  personal  injury  lawsuits
involving the alleged propensity of Bronco II utility vehicles to roll over. For
those cases in which damages have been specified,  the damages  specified by the
plaintiffs, including both actual and punitive damages, aggregated approximately
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2000.

     In most of the actions  described in the two  paragraphs  above,  no dollar
amount of damages is specified  or the  specific  amount we refer to is only the
jurisdictional  minimum.  It has been our experience that in cases that allege a
specific  amount  of  damages  in  excess of the  jurisdictional  minimum,  such
amounts,  on average,  bear little relation to the actual amounts of damages, if
any, paid by Ford in resolving such cases.  Any damages we pay generally are, on
average,  substantially less than the amounts originally claimed. In addition to
the pending  actions,  accidents have occurred and claims have arisen which also
may result in lawsuits in which the plaintiffs may allege similar defects.

     Asbestos.  We are a defendant in various  actions for  injuries  claimed to
have  resulted from alleged  contact with certain Ford parts and other  products
containing asbestos. The plaintiffs in these actions seek

                                       21

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

damages,  including  both actual and punitive  damages,  of  approximately  $1.7
billion at December 31, 2000. (In some of these actions, the plaintiffs have not
specified a dollar amount of damages or the specific  amount referred to is only
the jurisdictional  minimum.) As distinguished from most lawsuits against us, in
most of these asbestos-related cases, we are but one of many defendants.


Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     General.   We  have  received  notices  under  various  federal  and  state
environmental laws that we (along with others) may be a potentially  responsible
party for the costs associated with  remediating  numerous  hazardous  substance
storage,  recycling or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for
natural  resource  damages.  We also  may have  been a  generator  of  hazardous
substances  at a number of other sites.  The amount of any such costs or damages
for which we may be held responsible could be substantial. The contingent losses
that we expect to incur in connection with many of these sites have been accrued
and those losses are  reflected in our financial  statements in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting   principles.   However,  for  many  sites,  the
remediation  costs and other damages for which we ultimately  may be responsible
are not reasonably  estimable  because of uncertainties  with respect to factors
such as our  connection to the site or to materials  there,  the  involvement of
other  potentially  responsible  parties,  the  application  of laws  and  other
standards  or  regulations,  site  conditions,  and  the  nature  and  scope  of
investigations,  studies,  and  remediation  to  be  undertaken  (including  the
technologies  to  be  required  and  the  extent,   duration,   and  success  of
remediation). As a result, we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the
amount of costs or other  damages for which we are  potentially  responsible  in
connection with these sites, although that total could be substantial.

     MFA Grand Jury Matter. The U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"),  the EPA and
the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation   are  investigating  the  circumstances
surrounding  Ford's past use of an engine  control  strategy  that improved fuel
economy,  but had the side effect of increasing  nitrogen oxide  emissions.  The
engine control strategy (Managed Fuel Air, or "MFA") was used on 1997 model year
Econoline vans (about 60,000 vehicles). In an earlier civil investigation,  Ford
entered  into a  consent  decree  with the DOJ and the EPA and  agreed to pay $8
million in fines and special  projects,  in addition to recalling  the Econoline
vans. Ford also settled similar issues with CARB. We have met with attorneys and
investigators from the government and are cooperating in the investigation.

     Waste Disposal.  The EPA has initiated a civil  enforcement  action against
Ford as a result of Ford  Venezuela's  shipment  of  industrial  wastes from its
Valencia  Assembly  Plant in  Venezuela  for  disposal  in Texas.  Ford also has
received a subpoena  and been  notified  that it is the  subject of a grand jury
investigation  based on the same facts.  Ford  Venezuela  shipped the industrial
waste  to  the  U.S.  for  disposal  under  the  more  stringent  U.S.  disposal
requirements  because of the  unavailability of adequate disposal  facilities in
Venezuela  and to ensure  proper  disposal of the waste.  Although Ford believes
that the  subject  waste is  properly  classified  as  non-hazardous  under U.S.
environmental  laws, the EPA contends that even if the wastes do not exhibit any
hazardous  characteristics,  they  nevertheless  may be the product of a process
that is automatically deemed hazardous under applicable regulations.  If Ford is
determined to have violated EPA regulations  regarding the disposal of hazardous
wastes,  Ford could be required  to pay  substantial  fines  which could  exceed
$100,000.  It is impossible at this point in the  proceedings  to determine what
amount, if any, Ford may be required to pay.

     On-Board  Diagnostics  Investigation.  The EPA has  notified  Ford that the
system for  monitoring  fuel vapor leaks on about 6 million  1997-98  model year
vehicles  is  inadequate  and was not  described  fully in Ford's  certification
application.  The EPA may request that Ford  implement a recall to reprogram the
monitor.

     Ohio Assembly  Plant.  In September  1999, the EPA filed an  administrative
complaint  against Ford  alleging  violations of the Resource  Conservation  and
Recovery Act ("RCRA") at Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant. The alleged  violations are
related  to  Ford's  storage  of  hazardous  waste  and  the  absence  of a leak
monitoring program for paint equipment.  The EPA has proposed a civil penalty of
$303,745.  The  one  remaining  count  alleging  failure  to  implement  a  leak
monitoring program for paint equipment remains

                                       22

<PAGE>
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)


subject to discussion between Ford and the EPA.  Subsequent to the Ohio Assembly
enforcement  action,  Ford has received  notices of violation  alleging the same
noncompliance  at  other  facilities.   Ford  could  be  required  to  implement
monitoring  programs  at all U.S.  plants at an  initial  cost of  approximately
$110,000 and approximately $18,000 each year thereafter.


Class Actions
- -------------

     Paint Class Actions.  There are two purported class actions pending against
Ford in Texas and Illinois  alleging claims for fraud,  breach of warranty,  and
violations of consumer  protection  statutes.  The Texas case purports to assert
claims  on behalf of Texas  residents  who have  experienced  paint  peeling  in
certain 1984 through 1992 model year Ford  vehicles.  The Illinois case purports
to assert claims on behalf of residents of all states except Louisiana and Texas
who have  experienced  paint  peeling on most 1988  through 1997 model year Ford
vehicles.  Plaintiffs  in both cases  contend that their paint is defective  and
susceptible  to  peeling  because  Ford did not use  spray  primer  between  the
high-build  electrocoat  ("HBEC")  and the color coat.  The lack of spray primer
allegedly causes the adhesion of the color coat to the HBEC to deteriorate after
extended  exposure to ultraviolet  radiation  from sunlight.  Plaintiffs in both
cases seek unspecified  compensatory  damages (in an amount to cover the cost of
repainting  their vehicles and to compensate  for alleged  diminution in value),
punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and interest.

     In the Texas  case,  Sheldon,  the trial  court  certified a class of Texas
owners who experienced  paint peeling because of the alleged defect.  On May 11,
2000,  the Texas Supreme Court reversed the trial court,  decertified  the class
and remanded the case for further  proceedings.  Plaintiffs have filed a renewed
motion  for  class  certification  with the  trial  court.  The  Illinois  case,
Phillips,  is still in the early  stages of  litigation  and there  have been no
significant  developments in that case. We intend to pursue aggressively summary
dismissal and oppose class certification.

     TFI Module Class  Actions.  There are eight class actions  pending in state
courts in Alabama, California, Illinois (2 cases), Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee
and Washington,  alleging defects in thick film ignition modules in more than 22
million  vehicles  manufactured  by Ford  between  1983  and  1995.  With  minor
variations  based upon  state law and  differences  in the scope of the  classes
alleged, all of the cases involve the same legal claims and theories. The Howard
case in California is the lead case.

     The Howard  plaintiffs  assert two claims  for  relief:  violations  of the
California  Consumer  Legal  Remedies  Act  ("CLRA"),   and  violations  of  the
California  Unfair  Competition  Law  ("UCL").  Both  claims  are based upon the
allegation  that Ford  intentionally  concealed  a safety  defect in the subject
vehicles.  The  alleged  defect is that  distributor  mounted  TFI  modules  are
inordinately  prone to  failure  because  they are  exposed to  excessive  heat.
Plaintiffs  contend that TFI failure causes  stalling at highway speeds and that
stalling at highway speeds poses an  unreasonable  risk to motor vehicle safety.
They further contend that Ford knew about the alleged defect and concealed it by
withholding  documents from the Safety Administration during investigations into
stalling, secretly settling personal injury lawsuits in which TFI failure was at
issue,   falsely   advertising  its  vehicles  as  safe,   conducting  an  owner
notification  campaign  on certain  vehicles  rather than a safety  recall,  and
failing to report TFI warranty  claims and failures to the EPA.  Under the CLRA,
plaintiffs  seek a $1,000  statutory  penalty  per class  member  plus  punitive
damages. Under the UCL, plaintiffs seek a recall or "disgorgement" of the amount
Ford saved by not  conducting a recall.  If plaintiffs  are successful on all of
their claims, an adverse judgment in California could be as high as $4 billion.

     A jury  trial on the CLRA  claims in Howard  began in May 1999 and ended in
November  1999 with a  deadlocked  jury and a  mistrial.  If the CLRA claims are
retried,  the retrial  will  probably  occur in the second  quarter of 2001.  On
October  11,  the  court,  sitting  without a jury,  found  that  Ford  violated
California  law by concealing a safety defect.  The court ruled that  California
consumers who paid to replace  distributor-mounted  TFI modules were entitled to
restitution,  that Ford would be required  to recall

                                       23

<PAGE>
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)


the vehicles in the class,  and that plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys' fees
and expenses.  The amountand  method of restitution  and the nature and scope of
the recall will be determined  after further  hearings to be scheduled  before a
special master.

     Ford/Citibank  Visa Class Action.  Following the June 1997  announcement of
the termination of the Ford/Citibank credit card rebate program,  five purported
nationwide  class  actions and one purported  statewide  class action were filed
against Ford; Citibank is also a defendant in some of these actions. The actions
allege  damages in an amount up to $3,500  for each  cardholder  who  obtained a
Ford/Citibank credit card in reliance on the rebate program and who is precluded
from  accumulating  discounts  toward the purchase or lease of new Ford vehicles
after  December  1997 as a result  of the  termination  of the  rebate  program.
Plaintiffs  contend  that  defendants  deceptively  breached  their  contract by
unilaterally  terminating  the  program,  that  defendants  have  been  unjustly
enriched  as  a  result  of  the  interest   charges  and  fees  collected  from
cardholders, and further, that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of the
benefits of their credit card agreement.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory  damages,
or  alternatively,  reinstatement of the rebate program,  and punitive  damages,
costs,  expenses,  and  attorneys'  fees. The five  purported  nationwide  class
actions were filed in state courts in Alabama,  Illinois,  New York, Oregon, and
Washington,  and the purported  statewide class action was filed in a California
state court. The Alabama court has conditionally certified a class consisting of
Alabama  residents.  Ford  removed  all of the  cases to  federal  court,  which
consolidated  and  transferred  the cases to  federal  court in  Washington  for
pretrial  proceedings.   In  October  1999,  the  federal  court  dismissed  the
consolidated  proceedings for lack of jurisdiction  and sent each action back to
the state court in which it originated.  We have appealed this ruling.  Briefing
on the appeal has been completed and we are awaiting oral argument.

     Lease  Residual  Class Action.  In January 1998, in connection  with a case
pending in Illinois state court, Ford and Ford Credit were served with a summons
and  intervention  counterclaim  complaint  relating  to Ford  Credit's  leasing
practices  (Higginbotham  v. Ford Credit).  The  counterclaim  plaintiff,  Carla
Higginbotham,  is a member of a class that has been conditionally  certified for
settlement  purposes in Shore v. Ford  Credit.  In the Shore  case,  Ford Credit
commenced an action for deficiency against Virginia Shore, a Ford Credit lessee.
Shore  counterclaimed  for  purported  violations  of the  Truth-in-Leasing  Act
(alleging that certain lease charges were  excessive)  and the  Truth-in-Lending
Act (alleging  that the lease lacked  clarity).  Shore  purported to represent a
class of all similarly situated lessees. Ford was not a party to the Shore case.
Higginbotham  objected to the proposed settlement of the Shore case,  intervened
as a named  defendant,  filed separate  counterclaims  against Ford Credit,  and
joined Ford as an additional counterclaim defendant. Higginbotham asserts claims
against  Ford Credit for  violations  of the Consumer  Leasing Act,  declaratory
judgment  concerning the enforceability of early termination  provisions in Ford
Credit's  leases,  and fraud.  She also asserts a claim  against Ford Credit and
Ford for  conspiracy  to violate  the  Truth-in-Lending  Act.  The  Higginbotham
counterclaims allege that Ford Credit inflates the residual values of its leased
vehicles,  which results in lower monthly lease payments but higher  termination
fees for lessees who  exercise  their right of early  termination.  Higginbotham
claims that the early  termination  fees were not  adequately  disclosed  on the
lease form and that the fees are excessive and illegal  because of the allegedly
inflated  residual  values.  She also  alleged  that Ford  dictated the residual
values to Ford Credit and thereby participated in an unlawful  conspiracy.  This
case was stayed pending the  approval/rejection of the settlement in Shore. Ford
Credit has reached individual settlements with the Shore plaintiffs.

     The Illinois court in Higginbotham  found that the lease end residual value
of Ms.  Higginbotham's  vehicle  was  properly  valued  and,  as a  result,  Ms.
Higginbotham was an inadequate representative for the class.  Subsequently,  Ms.
Higginbotham   voluntarily  dismissed  her  intervention   counterclaim  without
prejudice  in the  Illinois  state court and has  reactivated  her initial  suit
against  Ford  Credit  (Ford is no longer a party to this  suit) in the  Florida
federal court,  pursuing  substantially  similar claims on behalf of herself and
others similarly situated.  Consequently, the Higginbotham case is proceeding in
Florida and Ford Credit is in the process of responding  to discovery  requests.
In addition,  Ford Credit has filed a response to  Plaintiff's  motion for class
certification  and  has  renewed  its  motion  for  summary  judgment  based  on
information obtained in discovery.

     Retail Lessee Insurance  Coverage Class Action.  On May 24, 1999,  Michigan
Mutual  Insurance  Company was served with a purported class action complaint in
federal court in Florida  alleging that the

                                       24

<PAGE>
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)


Ford Commercial, General Liability and Business Automobile Insurance Policy, and
the Personal  Auto  Supplement to that policy,  provides  uninsured/underinsured
motorist  coverage  and  medical  payments  coverage  to retail  lessees of Ford
vehicles  (e.g., to Red Carpet  lessees).  The Company is required to defend and
indemnify Michigan Mutual. The complaint rests on an untenable interpretation of
the Michigan  Mutual policy,  which was intended to cover company cars and lease
evaluation vehicles.  Unfortunately,  however, the Florida Court of Appeals in a
prior  action  brought  by  a  single  individual,   has  accepted   Plaintiffs'
interpretation  of  the  policy.  The  Florida  court's  opinion  should  not be
controlling in federal court,  however,  and Ford has filed a motion for summary
judgment  based  on the  policy  language  and  the  intention  of the  parties.
Plaintiffs responded to Ford's motion, cross-moved for summary judgment in their
favor,  moved to amend their  complaint,  and moved for class  certification.  A
hearing on Ford's motion was held on October 27, 2000,  and we expect a decision
sometime in 2001.

     Throttle Body Assemblies Class Action. A purported  nationwide class action
has been filed in Ohio on behalf of all  persons  who own or lease 1999  Mercury
Villagers.  The complaint alleges that the vehicle has a defective throttle body
assembly that causes the gas pedal to intermittently lock or stick in the closed
position. The complaint alleges breach of warranty, negligence, and violation of
consumer protection statutes.  Plaintiffs seek an order requiring Ford to recall
the vehicles.  They also seek unspecified  compensatory damages, treble damages,
attorneys  fees,  and costs.  We are seeking to have the case removed to federal
court.

     Hertz Stock Offer Class  Actions.  Twelve class  actions have been filed in
Delaware  state  court on  behalf  of the  minority  shareholders  of The  Hertz
Corporation  against the Company,  The Hertz  Corporation,  and the directors of
Hertz,  alleging that the Company  breached its fiduciary duties to the minority
shareholders of Hertz by offering,  on September 20, 2000, $30 per share for the
remaining shares of Hertz stock not already owned by the Company. The plaintiffs
alleged that the price offered was unfair and inadequate,  was not negotiated at
arms  length and was  designed  to benefit  Ford by  "capping"  the value of the
stock, and would deny them the full value of their stock.  They sought to enjoin
or  rescind  the  transaction,  recover  damages  and  profits,  and an award of
attorneys' fees. These actions were consolidated on October 19, 2000. In January
2001,  we agreed  with a special  committee  of Hertz's  board of  directors  to
increase  our offer to $35.50 per share.  In March  2001,  through a cash tender
offer and merger transaction, we acquired the publicly held shares of Hertz and,
as a result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford.

     Windstar  Transmission  Class Actions.  Three  purported  class actions are
pending,  alleging  that  Ford  marketed,  advertised,  sold,  and  leased  1995
Windstars in a deceptive manner by misrepresenting  their quality and safety and
actively  concealing  defects  in the  transmissions.  One  case is  pending  in
California (state court) and is limited to owners and lessees of that state. Two
cases are pending in Illinois  (one in federal court and one in state court) and
purport to represent owners and lessees from all states. Plaintiffs contend that
transmissions in the Windstar have prematurely  suffered from shifting  problems
and acceleration failures, requiring early replacement at substantial expense to
owners.  The cases assert  several  statutory and common law theories,  and seek
several types of relief,  including unspecified  compensatory damages,  punitive
damages,  and injunctive  relief. All three cases are in the very early stage of
litigation. Discovery has just begun in California, and has not yet begun in the
other two cases.

     Seat Back Class Actions.  Four purported  statewide class actions have been
filed in state  courts in  Maryland,  New  Hampshire,  New Jersey,  and New York
against Ford,  General Motors  Corporation and  DaimlerChrysler AG alleging that
seat backs with single recliner mechanisms are defective.  Plaintiffs in each of
these suits allege that seats installed in class vehicles (defined as almost all
passenger  cars  made  after  1991) are  defective  because  the seat  backs are
"unstable  and  susceptible  to  rearward  collapse  in the event of a  rear-end
collision.  The purported  class in each state consists of all persons who own a
class vehicle and specifically  excludes all persons who have suffered  personal
injury as a result of the rearward collapse of a seat.  Plaintiffs allege causes
of action for negligence,  strict liability,  implied warranty, fraud, and civil
conspiracy.  Plaintiffs  also  allege  violations  of  the  consumer  protection
statutes in the various states.  Plaintiffs seek "compensatory  damages measured
by the cost of  correcting  the  defect,  not to exceed  $5,000  for each  class
vehicle." Ford's motions to dismiss were granted in

                                       25

<PAGE>
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)


Maryland,  New Hampshire,  and New York;  plaintiffs' appeals from these rulings
are  pending in New York and  Maryland.  The trial  judge in the New Jersey case
denied Ford's motion to dismiss, and discovery is proceeding in that case.

     Ford Credit Debt  Collection  Class Actions.  Three class actions have been
filed  against  Ford  Credit  and PRIMUS  Automotive  Financial  Services,  Inc.
("PRIMUS") alleging unfair debt collection practices. In Pertuso v. Ford Credit,
a purported  nationwide  class  action,  plaintiffs  allege  that Ford  Credit's
policies and practices for obtaining  reaffirmation  agreements  violate Federal
law and constitute an unfair collection practice. This case was dismissed at the
trial  court  level  and  that  decision  was  upheld  by the  appellate  court.
Plaintiffs  have appealed to the United States Supreme  Court.  Molloy v. PRIMUS
and Dubois v. Ford Credit are two nationwide  class action  lawsuits  brought by
the same group of  plaintiff  attorneys.  Both  cases  allege  that Ford  Credit
attempts to collect on  discharged,  non-reaffirmed  debts in  violation  of the
Bankruptcy  Code,  the Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act and the  Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt  Organization  Act. In Molloy,  our motion to dismiss was
denied and we are proceeding  with  discovery.  In January 2001, the trial court
granted our motion to dismiss the Dubois case.  We  anticipate  that  plaintiffs
will appeal.

     Late Charges Class Actions.  There are two class actions, one in California
(Cumberland v. Ford Credit) and the other in Oklahoma (Crim v. Ford Credit),  in
which the  plaintiffs  are  contending  that Ford  Credit is  engaged  in unfair
business  practices by assessing  late  charges on lease  accounts  that bear no
reasonable  relation to our actual costs. In Cumberland (now captioned as Connie
Stickles et al. v. Ford Credit) the plaintiff has brought a purported nationwide
class  action  filed in the  Superior  Court of San  Francisco.  Plaintiffs  are
seeking  restitution,  punitive damages, and injunctive relief.  Basically,  the
claim  is  that  our  late  charge  of 7 1/2 % or $50,  whichever  is  less,  is
excessive.  There  has  been  extensive  discovery  and the  court  has  granted
nationwide  class  certification.  Trial is set to begin in the  second  quarter
2001.  However,  due to the unexpected death of our expert witness,  Ford Credit
has filed a motion for  continuance.  In Crim,  the  plaintiff  has made similar
allegations.  After granting a statewide class, the court granted our motion for
summary  judgment  because it found that the plaintiff had voluntarily  made the
late payments and was,  therefore,  precluded from bringing this action. We have
completed an extensive  study of the costs incurred by Ford Credit on delinquent
accounts and are confident that we can justify the late charge fee.

     Fair Lending Class Action.  Ford Credit has been served with a class action
lawsuit  in  federal  court in New York  alleging  that  our  pricing  practices
discriminate  against African  Americans.  Specifically,  plaintiffs allege that
although Ford Credit's initial credit risk scoring  analysis  applies  objective
criteria to calculate the  risk-related  "Buy Rate," Ford Credit then authorizes
dealers to impose a  subjective  component  in its credit  pricing  system - the
Mark-up  Policy - to  impose  additional  non-risk  charges.  It is the  alleged
subjective  mark-up  that  plaintiffs  allege   discriminates   against  African
Americans.  Ford  Credit  has filed a motion to  dismiss.  Ford and Ford  Credit
believe   that  Ford   Credit's   pricing   practices   are  fair  and  are  not
discriminatory.

     Performance  Management  Process Class Action. A purported class action was
filed in Wayne County Circuit Court in February 2001 against Ford, alleging that
the Company's  Performance  Management Process unlawfully  discriminates against
older  workers.  Individual  claims in that case allege  other forms of unlawful
discrimination.  This  case is in the  early  stage  of  litigation  and Ford is
preparing its response.

     Reverse  Discrimination Class Action. A purported class action was filed in
the Eastern  District of Michigan  in  February  2001  against  Ford and Jacques
Nasser,  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Ford,  alleging  reverse
discrimination.  Plaintiffs  claim that the  Company's  diversity  policies  and
practices  discriminate  against  older white  males.  This case is in the early
stage of litigation and Ford is preparing its response.

Other Matters
- -------------

     Red Carpet  Lease  Terminations.  The  Florida  Attorney  General  issued a
subpoena  asking for all Ford Credit Red Carpet Lease ("RCL") early  termination
accounts going back to 1991. The Florida Attorney General has been investigating
leasing  practices  at the  dealership  level for years  and is  representing  a
consortium of 37 states.  The  investigation  focuses on whether Ford Credit RCL
customers  who want to terminate  leases  early and purchase the leased  vehicle
have been misled by the dealers' alleged  improper  failure to itemize:  (i) the
cost to terminating the lease, and (ii) the vehicle  purchase price.  They claim
that because  Ford Credit  requires  the  customer to early  terminate  with the
originating  dealer,  we are conspiring with our dealer to mislead the customer.
We believe that Ford Credit's business  practices are fair under applicable law,
and we are  attempting to negotiate a resolution of the matter.  There have been
numerous and extensive  meetings with most of the Attorneys  General involved in
the 37 state  consortium.  We are confident that an amicable  resolution of this
matter will be reached.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
- ------------------------------------------------------------

     Ford held a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company on August 2,
2000.  The Special  Meeting was held to allow the  stockholders  to consider and
vote on a  recapitalization  proposal  known as Ford's  Value  Enhancement  Plan
("VEP").  The  VEP,  which  was  effected  through  a merger  of a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of Ford  into  Ford,  consisted  of the  exchange  by Ford  with its
stockholders  of cash and new  shares  of stock  for  existing  shares of stock,
resulting in a reshuffling  of the capital  structure of Ford.  The VEP proposal
was approved by the stockholders,  with 1,436,008,238  votes cast For (86.041%),
226,322,070  votes  cast  Against  (13.561%),   and  6,642,569  votes  abstained
(0.398%). There were no broker non-votes with respect to the proposal. Under the
VEP, Ford shareholders exchanged each of their old Ford common or Class B shares
for one new Ford  common or Class B share,  as the case may be,  plus,  at their
election,  either $20 in cash,  0.748  additional new Ford common  shares,  or a
combination of $5.17 in cash and 0.555  additional new Ford common shares.  As a
result of the  elections  made by  shareholders  under the VEP,  the total  cash
elected  was $5.7  billion  and the total  number of new Ford common and Class B
shares that became issued and outstanding was 1.893 billion.

old Ford Common  Stock who have not yet tendered  their  shares  pursuant to the
VEP) and 109 holders of Class B Stock.

     During  2000,  we sold  500,520  shares  of our  Common  Stock  in  private
transactions   that  were  not  registered  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission.  These  transactions  were  exempt  from  registration  requirements
because they were private placements under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.  These shares were sold in several,  unrelated transactions to
owners of an automotive dealership,  automotive recycling businesses,  and other
businesses in exchange for those  businesses.  The consideration we received for
the  shares  was  equal to the  market  value of the  shares  at the time of the
transactions.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of Operations
- -------------

In addition to specific  explanations  discussed below,  comparisons between our
2000 and 1999 fourth quarter and full year results are affected by the following
important events:

     o    On  August  7,  2000,   we   announced   the  final   results  of  our
          recapitalization,  known as our Value Enhancement Plan ("VEP"),  which
          became effective on August 2, 2000.  Under the VEP, Ford  shareholders
          exchanged  each of their old Ford Common or Class B shares for one new
          Ford  Common  or Class B share,  as the  case may be,  plus,  at their
          election, either $20 in cash, 0.748 additional new Ford Common shares,
          or a combination of $5.17 in cash and 0.555 additional new Ford Common
          shares.  As a result of the elections made by  shareholders  under the
          VEP,  the total cash  elected was $5.7 billion and the total number of
          new Ford Common and Class B shares that became issued and  outstanding
          was 1.893 billion.  See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated  Financial
          Statements  for a description of the effect of the VEP on earnings per
          share.

     o    On June 30, 2000,  we purchased  the Land Rover  business from the BMW
          Group.  Land Rover's  results and financial  condition are included in
          our financial  statements  on a  consolidated  basis  beginning in the
          third quarter of 2000.

     o    On June 28,  2000,  we  distributed  130  million  shares  of  Visteon
          Corporation,  which represented our 100% ownership interest,  by means
          of a tax-free  spin-off  in the form of a dividend  on Ford Common and
          Class B Stock. Visteon has been reflected as a discontinued  operation
          through June 30, 2000.  Our third and fourth  quarter 2000 results and
          financial condition exclude completely Visteon's results and financial
          condition.

     o    On March 31, 1999,  we purchased AB Volvo's  worldwide  passenger  car
          business  ("Volvo Car").  Volvo Car's results and financial  condition
          have been included in our financial statements on a consolidated basis
          since the second quarter of 1999.

FOURTH QUARTER 2000 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Our worldwide net income was $1,077  million in the fourth quarter of 2000,
or $0.57 per diluted share of Common and Class B Stock. In the fourth quarter of
1999,  earnings from continuing  operations  were $1,711  million,  or $1.39 per
diluted  share.  Worldwide  sales and revenues  were $42.6 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2000, down $1.3 billion, reflecting primarily lower unit volume. Unit
sales of cars and trucks were  1,840,000  units,  down 79,000 units,  reflecting
primarily lower production in North America in response to weaker demand.

     The  decrease in our fourth  quarter  Automotive  sector  earnings in North
America  reflects  primarily  lower  industry  volume and market  share and less
favorable product mix.

     The  improved  fourth  quarter  results in Europe  reflect  continued  cost

                  Memo: Ford's share of earnings in Hertz                  $ 45        $ 49        $ (4)
</TABLE>

     Ford  Credit's  consolidated  net income in the fourth  quarter of 2000 was
$410  million,  up $101  million  or 33% from 1999.  The  increase  in  earnings
reflects  primarily higher volume and an improved net financing  margin,  offset
partially by higher credit losses.

     Earnings at Hertz in the fourth quarter of 2000 were  $56 million (of which
$45 million  was Ford's share),  compared with earnings of $60 million (of which
$49 million was Ford's share) a year ago. The profit decline reflects  increased
pricing competition in the U.S. car rental and equipment rental businesses.

FULL-YEAR 2000 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Our worldwide  revenues  were $170.1  billion in 2000, up $9.4 billion from
1999. We sold 7,424,000  cars and trucks in 2000, up 204,000  units,  reflecting
primarily the addition of Land Rover and strong U.S. industry sales.

2000 Compared with 1999
- -----------------------

     Worldwide  earnings from  continuing  operations for our Automotive  sector
were  $3,624  million in 2000 on sales of  $141 billion,  compared  with  $4,986
million in 1999 on sales of $135  billion.  The  decrease in  earnings  reflects
asset impairment and restructuring charges in Europe and lower earnings in North
America,  offset  partially by improved  results in South America.  Adjusted for
constant  volume and mix,  our total  costs in the  Automotive  sector  declined
$500 million compared with 1999.

     Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing  operations in North America
were $4,886  million in 2000 on sales of $103.9  billion,  compared  with $5,418
million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings  deterioration  reflects
primarily  costs  associated  with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty

costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The
after-tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in
2000, down 7/10 of a percentage point from 1999.

     In 2000,  approximately  17.8  million new cars and trucks were sold in the
United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales
was 23.7% in 2000, down 1/10 of a percentage point from a year ago.

     Our Automotive  sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing
operations  in 2000,  compared  with  earnings  of $50  million a year ago.  The
decline  reflects  primarily  the second  quarter 2000 charge of $1,019  million
related to asset  impairment and  restructuring  costs for Ford brand operations
(see Note 19 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

     In 2000,  approximately  17.8  million new cars and trucks were sold in our
nineteen  primary  European  markets,  down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our
share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 2/10 of a percentage  point from
a year ago,  reflecting  primarily  an increase in market  share  related to our
acquisitions  of Volvo Car and Land Rover,  offset by a decrease in market share
of Ford brand. The decrease in our Ford brand share reflects primarily continued
aggressive competition.

     Our  Automotive  sector in South America lost $240 million from  continuing
operations  in  2000,  compared  with  a loss  of  $444  million  in  1999.  The
improvement  reflects  primarily  higher  vehicle  margins  resulting  from cost
reductions and improved product mix and pricing.

     In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil,
compared  with 1.3  million  in 1999.  Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in
2000,  down 6/10 of a  percentage  point from a year ago.  The decline in market
share reflects increased competition.

     Automotive  sector  earnings  from  continuing   operations  outside  North
America,  Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $108 million in 2000,
compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999.

     New car and truck sales in Australia,  our largest market in Rest of World,
were approximately 788,000 units in 2000, essentially unchanged from a year ago.
In 2000,  our combined car and truck market share in Australia  was 15.4%,  down
1.1  percentage  points  from  1999,  reflecting  primarily  strong  competitive
pressures.

1999 Compared with 1998
- -----------------------

     Worldwide  earnings from  continuing  operations for our Automotive  sector
were  $4,986  million in 1999 on sales of $135  billion,  compared  with  $4,049
million in 1998 on sales of $118  billion.  The  increase in earnings  reflected
improved  results in North  America,  offset  partially by lower earnings in all
other geographic markets.  Adjusted for constant volume and mix, our total costs
in the Automotive sector declined $1 billion compared with 1998.

     Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing  operations in North America
were  $5,418  million in 1999 on sales of $99.2  billion,  compared  with $3,997
million in 1998 on sales of $86.7 billion.  The earnings  improvement  reflected
primarily  increased  sales  volume,  an improved mix of light trucks and luxury
cars,  lower costs,  and the  non-recurrence  of 1998's  unusual  items,  offset
partially  by  higher  interest  expense,   lump-sum  payments  related  to  the
ratification  of  union  contracts  in  1999,  and  costs  related  to  employee
separation  programs in 1999.  The after-tax  return on sales for our Automotive
sector in North  America was 5.5% in 1999,  up 8/10 of a  percentage  point from
1998.

     In 1999,  approximately  17.4  million new cars and trucks were sold in the
United States,  up from 16 million  units in 1998. Our share of those unit sales
was  23.8%,  down 8/10 of a  percentage  point.  The

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)

decrease in market share reflected primarily capacity constraints on several key
products due to strong demand in the United States market.

     Our Automotive  sector earnings from  continuing  operations in Europe were
$50 million in 1999,  $101 million  worse than in 1998.  The  deterioration  was
explained by lower market share for Ford-branded vehicles,  primarily Mondeo and
Fiesta,  and unfavorable  vehicle mix, offset partially by the non-recurrence of
employee  separation  costs in 1998, lower taxes, the impact of unusual items in
1999, and the addition of Volvo Car.

     In 1999,  approximately  18.2  million new cars and trucks were sold in our
nineteen primary European markets, up from 17.2 million units in 1998. Our share
of those unit sales was 10.2% in 1999,  up 2/10 of a  percentage  point from the
prior year. The increase in our share was more than explained by the addition of
Volvo Car.

     Our  Automotive  sector in South America lost $444 million from  continuing
operations in 1999, compared with losses of $278 million in 1998. The decline in
earnings reflected primarily lower industry sales, lower market share in Brazil,
weak economic conditions,  devaluation of the Brazilian currency,  and increased
competition,  offset partially by lower costs and the non-recurrence of employee
separation costs in 1998.

     In 1999, approximately 1.3 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil,
compared  with 1.6  million  in 1998.  Our share of those unit sales was 9.7% in
1999, down 3.4 percentage points from 1998, reflecting increased competition.

     Automotive sector earnings from continuing operations in Rest of World were
$87  million in 1999,  down $92  million  from  1998.  The  decline in  earnings
reflected primarily higher taxes and lower sales volume, offset partially by our
share of the profit  improvement at Mazda and the  non-recurrence of a write-off
of our net exposure to Kia Motors Company in 1998.

     New car and truck sales in Australia,  our largest market in Rest of World,
were  approximately  787,000  units in 1999,  down 3% from  1998.  In 1999,  our
combined  car and  truck  market  share in  Australia  was  16.5%,  up 4/10 of a
percentage point.


FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Earnings  of  our  Financial  Services  sector  consist  primarily  of  two
segments,  Ford  Credit and  Hertz.  Details of our  Financial  Services  sector
earnings for 2000, 1999, and 1998 are shown below (in millions):

2000 Compared with 1999
- -----------------------

     Ford Credit's  consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million,  up $275
million or 22% from 1999.  Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflects
primarily  improved net  financing  margins and a higher  level of  receivables,
offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs.

     Earnings  at Hertz in 2000 were $358  million  (of which $292  million  was
Ford's  share).  In 1999,  Hertz had  earnings  of $336  million  (of which $273
million was Ford's share).  The increase in earnings  reflects  primarily strong
volume-related  performance,  offset  partially by downward pricing pressure and
higher interest costs.

1999 Compared with 1998
- -----------------------

     Ford Credit's  consolidated net income in 1999 was $1,261 million,  up $177
million or 16% from 1998. Compared with 1998, the increase in earnings reflected
primarily higher financing volumes and improved credit loss performance,  offset
partially  by  increased  operating  costs.  Higher  operating  costs  reflected
primarily  operating  costs of recent  acquisitions,  costs  associated with the
restructuring of financing operations, and employee separation programs.

     Earnings  at Hertz in 1999 were $336  million  (of which $273  million  was
Ford's  share).  In 1998,  Hertz had  earnings  of $277  million  (of which $224
million was Ford's share). The increase in earnings  reflected  primarily strong
demand,   improved  car  rental   pricing,   and  continuing   cost   efficiency
improvements.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Automotive Sector
- -----------------

     At December 31, 2000, our  Automotive  sector had $16.5 billion of cash and
marketable  securities,  down $5.2  billion from  December  31, 1999,  more than
explained by distributions for the Value Enhancement Plan ($5.6 billion),  share
repurchases ($1.1 billion), and acquisitions ($2.7 billion,  mainly Land Rover).
In addition to the cash on the balance  sheet,  we pre-funded  certain  employee
health benefit obligations in a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trust
totaling  $3.7  billion at December  31,  2000.  In the first  quarter and early
second  quarter of 2001,  we expect to incur cash  outlays of  approximately  $5
billion for employee compensation payments (primarily profit sharing), the final
payment to AB Volvo for our acquisition of Volvo Car, share repurchases, and our
acquisition of the minority interest in Hertz.

     In 2000,  we spent $7.4  billion  for  capital  goods,  such as  machinery,
equipment,  tooling,  and facilities,  used in our Automotive sector. This is up
$324 million from 1999, reflecting primarily the addition of Land Rover. Capital
expenditures were 5.2% of sales in 2000, unchanged from a year ago.

     Our  stockholders'  equity was $18.6 billion at December 31, 2000,  down $9
billion  compared with December 31, 1999. This decrease  reflects  primarily the
Value  Enhancement  Plan,  cash  dividends,  the  Visteon  spin-off,  the  share
repurchase  program,  and a reduction in other  comprehensive  income reflecting
foreign currency translation  adjustments related primarily to the strengthening
of the U.S.  dollar  relative to European  currencies,  offset  partially by net
income.

     At December 31, 2000, our Automotive  sector had total debt of $12 billion,
up $300 million. Debt at year-end 2000 was 39% of our total capitalization (that
is, the sum of our stockholders' equity and Automotive debt),  compared with 30%
of total capitalization at year-end 1999. The increase reflected primarily lower
stockholders' equity, as explained above.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Services Sector
- -------------------------

     At December 31, 2000, our Financial Services sector had cash and marketable
securities totaling $1.5 billion, down $111 million from December 31, 1999.

     Finance  receivables  and net  investment  in operating  leases were $171.8
billion  at  December 31, 2000,   up  $16.0  billion  from  December 31,   1999,
reflecting higher volume.

     Total debt was $153.5  billion at December 31, 2000,  up $13.6 billion from
December 31,  1999.  Outstanding  commercial  paper at December 31, 2000 totaled
$42.3  billion  at Ford  Credit  and $2.3  billion  at  Hertz,  with an  average
remaining maturity of 35 days and 18 days, respectively.

     For a discussion of the credit and other financial  support  facilities for
our Financial Services sector at December 31, 2000,  see Note 13 (page FS-22) of
our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


HERTZ PURCHASE

     In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired
(for a total price of about $750  million) the common stock of Hertz that we did
not own, which  represented  about 18% of the economic  interest in Hertz.  As a
result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD

     We will adopt  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging",  on January 1, 2001, as
described  in  Note 1  (page  FS-10)  of our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.


OUTLOOK

Industry Sales Volumes
- ----------------------

Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2001 in
our major markets is as follows:
<TABLE>

      United States - between 16.0 million and 16.5 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units
                      sold in 2000

      Europe        - approximately 17.7 million units, compared with the 17.8 million units sold in 2000
                      (both figures based on 19 markets)

      Brazil        - approximately 1.6 million units, compared with the 1.5 million units sold in 2000

difficulties in South America or Asia;  higher fuel prices;  a market shift from
truck sales in the United  States;  lower-than-anticipated  residual  values for
leased  vehicles;  labor or other  constraints on our ability to restructure our
business;  increased  safety or emissions  regulation  resulting in higher costs
and/or sales  restrictions;  work stoppages at key Ford or supplier  facilities;
and the  discovery  of  defects  in  vehicles  resulting  in delays in new model
launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

     We are  exposed  to a variety  of market  and asset  risks,  including  the
effects of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,
interest rates, and specific asset risks.  These risks affect our Automotive and
Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as
an integral part of our overall risk management  program,  which  recognizes the
unpredictability  of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially  adverse effect
on our results.

     The effect of changes in exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,  and interest
rates on our earnings  generally  has been small  relative to other factors that
also  affect  earnings,  such as unit  sales  and  operating  margins.  For more
information  on these  financial  exposures,  see Notes 1 and 18 of our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The market  risks of our  Automotive  sector and the market and other risks
and capital adequacy of Ford Credit,  which comprises  substantially  all of our
Financial Services sector, are discussed and quantified below.


Automotive Market Risk

     Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts  denominated
in foreign currencies,  including the following: purchases and sales of finished
vehicles and production  parts; debt and other payables;  subsidiary  dividends;
and investments in affiliates.  These expenditures and receipts create exposures
to  changes  in  exchange  rates.  We also are  exposed  to changes in prices of
commodities used in our Automotive sector.

Foreign Currency Risk
- ---------------------

     We use derivative  financial  instruments to hedge assets,  liabilities and
firm  commitments  denominated  in foreign  currencies.  Our  hedging  policy is
defensive,  based on clearly  defined  guidelines.  Speculative  actions are not
permitted. We do not use complex derivative instruments.  We use a value-at-risk
("VAR")  analysis  to  evaluate  our  exposure  to changes  in foreign  currency
exchange rates. The primary assumptions used in the VAR analysis are as follows:

     o    A Monte Carlo  simulation  model is used to  calculate  changes in the
          value of currency derivative  instruments (e.g., forwards and options)
          and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an
          18-month  exposure  and  derivative  hedging  horizon  and a one-month
          holding period.

     o    The  VAR  analysis   calculates  the  potential  risk,  within  a  99%
          confidence  level,  on  cross-border  currency  cash  flow  exposures,
          including the effects of foreign  currency  derivatives.  (Translation
          exposures  are not  included  in the VAR  analysis).  The Monte  Carlo
          simulation model uses historical  volatility and correlation estimates
          of the  underlying  assets to produce a large  number of future  price
          scenarios which have a statistically lognormal distribution.

     o    Estimates of correlations  and  volatilities  are drawn primarily from
          the JP Morgan RiskMetricsTM datasets.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


     Based on our overall currency  exposure  (including  derivative  positions)
during  2000,  the risk  during  2000 to our  pre-tax  cash flow  from  currency
movements was on average less than $300 million, with a high of $350 million and
a low of $275 million. At December 31, 2000, currency movements are projected to
affect our pre-tax cash flow over the next 18 months by less than $300  million,
within a 99%  confidence  level.  Compared  with our  projection at December 31,
1999,  the 2000 VAR  amount is  approximately  $125  million  higher,  primarily
because of  significantly  increased  currency  exchange rate volatility and the
inclusion of Land Rover currency exposures and hedges.

Commodity Price Risk
- --------------------

     We enter into commodity  forward and option  contracts.  Such contracts are
executed to offset our  exposure to the  potential  change in prices  mainly for
various  non-ferrous  metals  (e.g.,  aluminum)  used  in the  manufacturing  of
automotive components. The fair value liability of such contracts, excluding the
underlying  exposures,  as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 was  approximately  $56
million and $223 million,  respectively.  The potential change in the fair value
of  commodity  forward  and  option  contracts,  assuming  a 10%  change  in the
underlying commodity price, would be approximately $280 million and $300 million
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting
impact  of  the  price  change  in  the  physical  purchase  of  the  underlying
commodities.


FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS

     In the normal  course of business,  Ford Credit is exposed to several types
of risk. These risks include primarily credit, residual, interest rate, currency
and liquidity risks. Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its
contribution  to Ford  Credit's  overall  global risk.  Business  decisions  are
evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these
risks.

     Following is a discussion of Ford Credit's risk  management  practices used
to manage more than 90% of Ford Credit's  worldwide net finance  receivables and
operating leases, which equaled $122.7 billion and $38.5 billion,  respectively,
at December 31, 2000, and essentially all liabilities and equity. Ford Credit is
continuously reviewing and improving its risk management practices and extending
these risk management practices to its remaining portfolio around the world.

Credit Risk
- -----------

     Credit risk is the  possibility  of loss from a customer's  failure to make
payments  according to contract terms.  Ford Credit actively manages credit risk
of consumer and non-consumer products to balance the level of risk and return.

Consumer Credit

     Retail products (vehicle  installment sale and lease contracts) are divided
into more than 75 segments by risk tier,  term and whether the vehicle  financed
is new or used.  This segment  data are used to assist with  product  pricing to
ensure risk factors are  appropriately  considered.  Data  segmentation is  also
used in contract  servicing  to make certain that  contracts  receive  attention
appropriate to their risk level. In addition,  Ford Credit is reorganizing  into
regional service centers to streamline retail customer service activities and to
realize economies of scale from the latest servicing technology.

     Credit  investigations  include a credit  bureau  review of each  applicant
together with an internal review and  verification  process.  Retail credit loss
management  strategy is based on  historical  experience of more than 15 million
contracts.  Statistically-based  retail  credit risk  rating  models are used to
determine the  creditworthiness  of applicants.  The accuracy of these models is
reviewed and revalidated  quarterly against actual performance and recalibrated,
as necessary.

                                       48

<PAGE>

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


     Ford  Credit  has  developed  behavioral  models to  assist in  determining
optimal  collection  strategies.  Accounts  are  placed in risk  categories  for
collection  follow-up.  Reasonable  efforts  are made to collect  on  delinquent
accounts and keep accounts current.  Repossession is considered a last resort. A
repossessed  vehicle is sold and proceeds are applied to the amount owing on the
receivable.   Ford's  Vehicle   Remarketing   Department  manages  the  sale  of
repossessed vehicles, seeking the highest net price for the vehicle.  Collection
of the remaining balance continues after  repossession until the account is paid
in full or is deemed uncollectible by Ford Credit.

Non-Consumer Credit

     Ford Credit extends non-consumer credit primarily to vehicle dealers in the
form of  approved  lines  of  credit  to  purchase  inventories  of new and used
vehicles. In addition, Ford Credit provides mortgage,  working capital and other
types  of  loans  to  dealers.   Ford  Credit  also  provides  state  and  local
governments,  leasing and daily  rental  companies  as well as other  commercial
entities with financing for their automotive needs.

     Each  non-consumer  loan  is  evaluated,   taking  into  consideration  the
borrower's  financial  condition,   collateral,  debt  servicing  capacity,  and
numerous  other  financial and  qualitative  factors.  All credit  exposures are
reviewed at least annually with special loan committees  reviewing higher credit
exposures.

     To monitor potential credit  deterioration,  dealers are required to submit
monthly  financial  statements.  An evaluation rating is assigned to each dealer
and physical audits of vehicle inventory are performed periodically, with higher
audit  frequency  for higher risk  dealers.  In  addition,  inventory  financing
payoffs are monitored  daily to detect  adverse  deviations  from typical payoff
patterns, in which case appropriate actions are taken.

Residual Risk
- -------------

     Residual risk is the possibility that the actual proceeds  realized by Ford
Credit upon the sale of returned  vehicles  at lease  termination  will be lower
than the internal forecast of residual values.

     In general, lease contracts are written with vehicle lease-end values based
on Automotive Leasing Guide (ALG) residual  guidelines.  For financial reporting
purposes,  however,  Ford Credit sets the  internal  value of expected  residual
values  (net of  costs)  based on a  proprietary  econometric  model  that  uses
historical experience and forward-looking  information available to Ford Credit.
This  information  includes new product  plans,  marketing  programs and quality
metrics.  Any  unfavorable  gap between  Ford  Credit's  internal  forecast  and
contract  lease-end  value is  reserved on the  balance  sheet as  depreciation.
Reserve  adequacy  is reviewed  quarterly  to reflect  changes in the  projected
values.

     At lease  termination,  Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the
use of models to  determine  which  geographic  market  would  yield the highest
resale value, net of transportation cost. Lease extensions or early terminations
also may be offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns.

Financial Market Risk
- ---------------------

     The goal of  financial  market  risk  management  is to reduce  the  profit
volatility  effect of changes in interest  rates and  currency  exchange  rates.
Interest rate and currency exposures are monitored and managed by Ford Credit as
an integral part of its overall risk management  program,  which  recognizes the
unpredictability  of  financial  markets and seeks to reduce  potential  adverse
effects on Ford  Credit's  operating  results.  Risk is reduced in two ways:  1)
through the use of funding  instruments that have interest and maturity profiles
similar to the assets they are funding,  and 2) through the use of interest rate
and  foreign  exchange  derivatives.   Ford  Credit's  derivatives  strategy  is
defensive; derivatives are not used for speculative purposes.

                                       49

<PAGE>
Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


Interest Rate Risk

     Ford  Credit's   asset  base  consists   primarily  of  fixed-rate   retail
installment sale and lease  contracts,  with an average life of about two years,
and floating rate inventory  financing  receivables.  Funding sources consist of
short-term  commercial  paper, term debt and receivable sales. To ensure funding
availability over a business cycle,  Ford Credit often borrows  longer-term debt
(five to ten  years).  Interest  rate  swaps  are used to  change  the  interest
characteristics  of the debt to match the interest rate  characteristics of Ford
Credit's assets. This matching locks in margins and reduces profit volatility. A
portion of assets are funded with equity, and volatility can occur as changes in
interest  rates impact the market value of equity.  This  volatility  is usually
small.

     The interest  rate  sensitivity  of Ford Credit's  assets and  liabilities,
including hedges, is evaluated each month. In addition,  the hedging strategy is
stress-tested  periodically  to  ensure  it  remains  effective  over a range of
potential changes in interest rates.

     Assuming  an  instantaneous  increase of one  percentage  point in interest
rates  applied to all  financial  assets,  debt and  hedging  instruments,  Ford
Credit's  after-tax  earnings  would  decline by $54  million  over the  ensuing
twelve-month period.

Currency Risk

     Ford Credit  generally  manages  assets and  liabilities  in local  country
currency, thus eliminating exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different
currency is used,  Ford Credit  typically  uses foreign  currency  agreements to
hedge specific debt instruments and intercompany  loans.  Ford Credit's earnings
in the  ensuing  twelve-month  period  would not be  materially  affected by the
change  in the  value  of Ford  Credit's  financial  assets,  debt  and  hedging
instruments resulting from an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency rates
relative to the U.S. dollar.

Counterparty Risk

     Counterparty  risk  relates to the loss to Ford  Credit that could occur if
the  counterparty  to an interest  rate or foreign  currency  hedging or similar
contract  with Ford  Credit  defaults.  Ford and Ford Credit  jointly  establish
exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide  counterparty
diversification.  Exposures to  counterparties,  including the mark-to-market on
derivatives, are monitored on a perodic basis.

Liquidity Risk
- --------------

     Liquidity  risk is the  possibility of being unable to meet all present and
future  financial  obligations  as they come  due.  One of Ford  Credit's  major
objectives is to maintain funding  availability through any economic or business
cycle. Ford Credit focuses on developing  funding sources to support both growth
and  refinancing  maturing  debt.  Ford  Credit also issues debt that on average
matures later than assets liquidate, further enhancing overall liquidity.

     Ford Credit is one of the world's largest issuers of corporate debt. Global
funding activities include the direct sale of commercial paper, the placement of
term debt to retail and institutional investors and the sale of receivables.

     Management  closely  monitors the amount of  short-term  funding and mix of
short-term funding to total debt, the overall  composition of total debt and the
availability  of  committed  credit  facilities  in  relation  to the  level  of
outstanding  short-term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credit's liquidity position
is conducted periodically.

     Recent  efforts to provide  additional  sources of  liquidity  and  further
diversify  Ford  Credit's  funding base include the reduction in the reliance on
short-term debt and the development of more efficient term debt instruments.  In
1999,  Ford  Credit   implemented  the  first  Corporate   Global  Bond  Program
(GlobLSTM),

                                       50

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)

which  offers  large  liquid  transactions  with broad  investor  participation,
investor  loyalty,  and  enhanced  secondary  market  performance.  Other  major
initiatives  include a multi-issuer  Euro  medium-term  note program for certain
international  affiliates and the first corporate Internet bond offering.  Also,
the sale of receivables through  asset-backed  securitization  "ABS" program was
expanded to appeal to a global investor base -- the first global ABS transaction
was issued by Ford Credit in 2000.  The sale of  asset-backed  commercial  paper
also adds to Ford Credit's funding capacity.

     Ford Credit has,  and has the  ability to use  Ford's,  committed  lines of
credit from major banks, which provide additional levels of liquidity. (See Note
13 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements for a detailed  discussion of
these credit lines).  About 70% of these facilities have five-year terms.  These
facilities do not contain restrictive financial covenants (e.g.,  debt-to-equity
limitations)  or material  adverse change clauses that could preclude  borrowing
under these facilities.


FORD CREDIT CAPITAL ADEQUACY

     Underlying Ford Credit's risk and capital management strategies is the need
to effectively leverage capital in a way that:

     o    Protects  creditors  against  worst-case  unexpected losses consistent
          with Ford Credit's debt ratings.
     o    Provides  adequate returns by pricing products  commensurate  with the
          level of risk.

     Ford Credit's capital management  framework optimizes the use of capital by
sizing equity in proportion to risk.  Ford Credit manages its capital  structure
and makes adjustments as the level of portfolio risk changes. A capital adequacy
study that quantifies the sources of creditors' risk protection and stress tests
risks is performed semi-annually.

Sources of Creditor Risk Protection
- -----------------------------------

     In evaluating  the sources of creditor risk  protection,  Ford Credit looks
beyond equity stated in its financial statements, and analyzes cash flows in the
event of  worst-case  unexpected  losses.  Net revenue from the  existing  asset
portfolio,  credit loss reserves,  residual loss reserves,  and net deferred tax
liabilities provide incremental creditor risk protection,  in addition to stated
equity on the balance sheet.  Ford Credit believes that the traditional  view of
capital adequacy,  expressed as debt-to-equity ratios, excludes other sources of
creditor risk protection, understating creditor risk protection.

     Ford Credit's objective is to provide customers with  competitively  priced
financing  products.  In  addition to taking into  consideration  borrowing  and
operating costs,  Ford Credit's pricing model includes factors related to credit
and residual risks, profits and related income taxes. To date, total net revenue
from the existing asset portfolio has been sufficient to cover both expected and
unexpected losses.  For example,  Ford Credit continued to be profitable even in
periods when it experienced  higher-than-normal  credit losses (late 1980's) and
residual losses (late 1990's).  Creditor risk  protection  associated with total
net revenue is evaluated using a conservative  estimate of lifetime expected net
income and related income taxes from the existing portfolio, after consideration
of defaults associated with stress testing.

     Additional sources of creditor risk protection,  in the form of reserves on
the balance  sheet,  include  credit loss reserves and residual  loss  reserves.
Credit and residual loss reserves are established to reflect partial  impairment
of  underlying  asset  values as recorded  on the balance  sheet due to expected
losses. Establishment of these reserves results in a charge to earnings (equity)
before actual losses occur.  Because these reserves are  established in addition
to credit and  residual  loss  expectation  factors  included in  pricing,  they
protect creditors if actual losses exceed initial loss expectations.

     Net  deferred  tax  liabilities  reflect  timing  differences  between  the
financial statement and tax treatment of revenues and expenses.  In the event of
unexpected  losses,  the net  deferred tax  liability  is reduced or  eliminated
without any actual tax payment,  thus providing an additional source of creditor
risk protection.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


Quantifying Risk Through Stress Testing
- ---------------------------------------

     As part of Ford Credit's  capital  adequacy  study,  the asset portfolio is
stress tested semiannually to simulate lifetime worst-case unexpected losses and
define the level of capital  required.  The results of this study are integrated
into the pricing of Ford Credit's products by allocating a capital charge to all
products consistent with the underlying risks of each product.

     The  stress  test  study is  based  on  statistical  modeling  of  lifetime
worst-case unexpected losses for each asset class.  Worst-case unexpected losses
are calculated at a 99.9% confidence level,  consistent with bond default levels
for  single A rated  companies.  All risk  drivers in the  portfolio  are stress
tested,  including  the  likelihood  that all  segments  of the  portfolio  will
experience  worst-case losses at the same time. Following is a discussion of the
methodology used to stress test consumer credit risk and residual losses:

     o    Consumer  credit  loss  stress  testing  is  based  on the  historical
          experience of nearly fifteen million  liquidated  contracts  purchased
          since 1984. The historic  portfolio is stratified and the distribution
          and correlations of defaults for each group are analyzed.  Finally,  a
          simulation  model  is used to  replicate  potential  retail  portfolio
          behavior  in  worst-case  scenarios,  assuming  that  distribution  of
          defaults is statistically lognormal.

     o    Residual loss stress testing is based on the historical  experience of
          dispositions  since 1993 and  assumes  that all of the  vehicles  from
          non-defaulting  leases  will be  returned to Ford Credit at the end of
          the lease term. The historic portfolio is stratified and a statistical
          model is used to estimate the volatility of auction  values.  Finally,
          to compensate  for limited  historical  data, 30 years of used vehicle
          price volatility is incorporated.

Capital Adequacy Study Conclusions
- ----------------------------------
     To assess Ford Credit's  capital  adequacy,  stress-testing  results (total
lifetime  worst-case  unexpected  losses)  are  compared  against all sources of
creditor risk  protection.  At December 31, 2000,  Ford Credit believed that its
creditors had risk protection of more than 150% of modeled worst-case unexpected
losses for any  operational and other risks that may not have been quantified in
the study. Ford Credit updates the capital adequacy study semi-annually. Capital
will be  adjusted  as the  level of risk and  other  sources  of  creditor  risk
protection changes.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                   ------------------------------------------

NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies
- ----------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
- ---------------------------

The consolidated  financial  statements include all majority-owned  subsidiaries
and reflect the operating  results,  assets,  liabilities and cash flows for the
Company's two business sectors:  Automotive and Financial  Services.  The assets
and  liabilities  of  the  Automotive   sector  are  classified  as  current  or
noncurrent,  and  those  of the  Financial  Services  sector  are  unclassified.
Affiliates that are 20% to 50%  owned,  principally  Mazda Motor Corporation and
AutoAlliance  International  Inc., and subsidiaries where control is expected to
be temporary,  principally investments in certain dealerships, are accounted for
on an equity basis. Use of estimates and assumptions as determined by management
is  required  in  the  preparation  of  consolidated   financial  statements  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles.  Actual results could
differ from those  estimates  and  assumptions.  For  purposes of these Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  "Ford" or "the  Company"  means Ford Motor
Company  and its  majority-owned  consolidated  subsidiaries  unless the context
requires  otherwise.  Certain  amounts for prior  periods are  reclassified,  if
required, to conform to present period presentations.

Structure of Operations
- -----------------------

The Company's sectors,  Automotive and Financial Services,  are managed as three
primary  operating  segments.  A segment is defined as a component with business
activity   resulting  in  revenue  and  expense  that  has  separate   financial
information  evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker
in  determining  resource  allocation and assessing  performance  (Note 21). The
Automotive sector (and segment) consists of the design,  manufacture,  sale, and
service of cars and trucks. The Financial Services sector primarily includes two
segments, Ford Motor Credit Company and its subsidiaries ("Ford Credit") and The
Hertz Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Hertz").  The Financial Services sector
also includes less significant financial services businesses. Ford Credit leases
and finances  the purchase of cars and trucks made by Ford and other  companies.
It also  provides  inventory  and  capital  financing  to  retail  car and truck
dealerships.  Hertz  rents  cars and  trucks  and  industrial  and  construction
equipment.  Both Ford Credit and Hertz also have insurance operations related to
their businesses.

Intersector  transactions  represent principally  transactions  occurring in the
ordinary  course  of  business,  borrowings  and  related  transactions  between
entities in the  Financial  Services and  Automotive  sectors,  and interest and
other support under special vehicle financing  programs.  These arrangements are
reflected in the respective business sectors.

Revenue Recognition - Automotive Sector
- ---------------------------------------

Sales are generally recorded by the Company when products are shipped to dealers
and  other  customers  and title is  transferred,  except  as  described  below.
Estimated costs for approved sales incentive programs normally are recognized as
sales  reductions at the latter of a) the time of revenue  recognition or b) the
date the incentive program is approved.

Sales through  dealers to certain daily rental  companies where the daily rental
company has an option to require Ford to repurchase  vehicles subject to certain
conditions  are  recognized  over the period of daily rental service in a manner
similar to lease accounting.  The carrying value of these vehicles,  included in
other current assets, was $2.0 billion at both December 31, 2000 and 1999.

                                      FS-7

<PAGE>


NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies (continued)
- ----------------------------

Revenue Recognition - Financial Services Sector
- -----------------------------------------------

Revenue from finance  receivables is recognized  over the term of the receivable
using the  interest  method.  Certain  loan  origination  costs are deferred and
amortized, using the interest method, over the term of the related receivable as
a reduction in financing revenue. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on
a straight-line  basis over the term of the lease.  Initial direct costs, net of
acquisition fees related to leases,  are deferred and amortized over the term of
the lease. Agreements between Automotive sector operations and certain Financial
Services sector  operations  provide for interest and residual value supplements
and other support costs to be paid by  Automotive  sector  operations on certain
financing and leasing  transactions.  The Financial  Services sector  recognizes
this revenue in income over the period that the related  receivables  and leases
are outstanding;  the estimated costs of interest and residual value supplements
and other  support costs are recorded as sales  incentives by Automotive  sector
operations in the same manner as sales incentives described above.

The  accrual  of  interest  on  loans  is  discontinued  at the  time a loan  is
determined  to  be  impaired.  Subsequent  amounts  of  interest  collected  are
recognized  in  income  only if full  recovery  of the  remaining  principal  is
probable.  Other amounts collected are generally recognized first as a reduction
of principal. Any remaining amounts are treated as a recovery.

The Financial  Services sector  periodically sells finance  receivables  through
special  purpose  subsidiaries,  retains the servicing  rights and certain other
beneficial  interests,  and  receives a  servicing  fee which is  recognized  as
collected  over the  remaining  term of the related  sold  finance  receivables.
Estimated gains or losses from the sale of finance receivables are recognized in
the period in which the sale  occurs.  In  determining  the gain or loss on each
qualifying  sale of finance  receivables,  the investment in the sold receivable
pool is  allocated  between the portion sold and the portion  retained  based on
their relative fair values at the date of sale.

Other Costs
- -----------

Advertising  and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are included
in  selling,   administrative,   and  other  expenses.  Advertising  costs  were
$3.0 billion in 2000, $2.7 billion in 1999 and $2.1 billion in 1998.

Estimated costs related to product  warranty are accrued at the time of sale and
are included in cost of sales.

Engineering,  research and development  costs are included in cost of sales, are
expensed as incurred,  and were $6.8 billion in 2000,  $6.0 billion in 1999, and
$5.3 billion in 1998.

Income Per Share of Common and Class B Stock
- --------------------------------------------

Basic income per share of Common and Class B Stock is calculated by dividing the
income  attributable to Common and Class B Stock by the average number of shares
of Common and Class B Stock outstanding during the applicable  period,  adjusted
for shares issuable under employee savings and compensation plans.

The  calculation  of diluted  income per share of Common and Class B Stock takes
into account the effect of obligations,  such as stock options, considered to be
potentially dilutive.

Derivative Financial Instruments
- --------------------------------

Ford has operations in over 30 countries and sells vehicles in over 200 markets,
and is exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in
foreign currency  exchange rates,  interest rates, and commodity  prices.  These
financial exposures are monitored and managed by the Company as an integral part
of  the  Company's  overall  risk  management  program,   which  recognizes  the
unpredictability  of  financial  markets  and  seeks to reduce  the  potentially
adverse effect on the Company's results.  The Company uses derivative  financial
instruments to manage the exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates,  interest
rates, and commodity prices. All derivative financial instruments are classified
as "held for purposes other than trading"; company policy specifically prohibits
the use of  leveraged  derivatives  or use of any  derivatives  for  speculative
purposes.

Ford's primary foreign currency  exposures,  in terms of net corporate exposure,
are in the Swedish krona,  euro,  British pound sterling,  Japanese yen, Mexican
peso,  and Brazilian  real.  Agreements  to manage  foreign  currency  exposures
include forward contracts, swaps, and options. The Company uses these derivative
instruments to hedge assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign  currencies,
firm commitments,  and certain  investments in foreign  subsidiaries.  Gains and
losses  on hedges of firm  commitments  are  deferred  and  recognized  with the
related  transactions.  In the case of  hedges  of net  investments  in  foreign
subsidiaries,  gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive  income to
the  extent  they are  effective  as  hedges.  All other  gains and  losses  are
recognized in cost of sales for the Automotive  sector and interest  expense for
the Financial Services sector.  These instruments  usually mature in three years
or less for Automotive sector exposures and longer for Financial Services sector
exposures, consistent with the underlying transactions. The effect of changes in
exchange  rates  may  not be  fully  offset  by  gains  or  losses  on  currency
derivatives, depending on the extent to which the exposures are hedged.

Interest  rate swap  agreements  are used to manage the effects of interest rate
fluctuations by changing the interest rate  characteristics  of specific debt or
pools  of debt to match  the  interest  rate  characteristics  of  corresponding
assets.  These  instruments  mature  consistent  with  underlying debt issues as
identified in Note 13.  The differential paid or received on interest rate swaps
is recognized on an accrual  basis as an adjustment to interest  expense.  Gains
and losses on  terminated  interest  rate swaps are  deferred  and  reflected in
interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt.

                                      FS-9

NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies (continued)
- ----------------------------

Ford has a commodity  hedging program that uses primarily  forward contracts and
options to manage the effects of changes in commodity  prices on the  Automotive
sector's  results.  Gains and losses are  recognized in cost of sales during the
settlement period of the related transactions.

The Company will adopt Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) 133,
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging",  on January 1, 2001. Based
on present  interpretation  of this new standard,  the Company estimates that it
will  record a  transition  adjustment  that will  reduce 2001 net income by $70
million and reduce other comprehensive income by $550 million.  Adoption of this
standard  will  result  in  non-cash   adjustments   to  income  and  equity  by
unpredictable  amounts,  based  mainly on periodic  changes in  interest  rates,
exchange rates, and commodity prices.  The amount of these non-cash effects will
be disclosed each quarter.

Foreign Currency Translation
- ----------------------------

Assets  and  liabilities  of  non-U.S.  subsidiaries  for which  the  functional
currency is other than the U.S. dollar are generally  translated to U.S. dollars
at  end-of-period  exchange  rates.  The  effects of this  translation  for most
non-U.S.  subsidiaries are reported in other comprehensive income. Remeasurement
of assets and liabilities of non-U.S.  subsidiaries  that use the U.S. dollar as
their  functional  currency  are  included  in income as  transaction  gains and
losses. Income statement elements of all non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated to
U.S. dollars at average-period exchange rates. Also included in income are gains
and losses  arising from  transactions  denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency of the entity involved. Net transaction gains and losses, as
described above,  decreased income from continuing operations by $115 million in
2000,  increased income from continuing  operations by $308 million in 1999, and
increased income from continuing operations by $84 million in 1998.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Certain Identifiable Intangibles
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment on
an ongoing basis. Such evaluations  compare operating income before amortization
of  goodwill  to the  amortization  recorded  for the  operations  to which  the
goodwill relates. When appropriate,  the Company also periodically evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived  assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of for
potential impairment.  The Company considers projected future operating results,
cash  flows,  trends,  and other  circumstances  in making  such  estimates  and
evaluations.

Goodwill
- --------

Goodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets of acquired companies and is amortized using the straight-line method
for  periods  of up to 40  years.  Total  goodwill  included  in the  Automotive
sector's  other assets was $5.8 billion at December 31, 2000 and $5.7 billion at
December 31, 1999. Total goodwill  included in the Financial  Services  sector's
other  assets  was $993  million  at  December  31,  2000 and  $970  million  at
December 31, 1999.

Company-Obligated  Mandatorily  Redeemable  Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary
Trust
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During  1995,  Ford Motor  Company  Capital  Trust I (the  "Trust")  issued $632
million  of  its  9% Trust  Originated   Preferred  Securities  (the  "Preferred
Securities")  in a one-for-one  exchange for 25,273,537  shares of the Company's
outstanding  Series B Depositary  Shares (the "Depositary  Shares").  Concurrent
with  the  exchange  and the  related  purchase  by Ford of the  Trust's  Common
Securities  (the  "Common  Securities"),  the  Company  issued to the Trust $651
million aggregate principal amount of its 9% Junior Subordinated  Debentures due
December 2025 (the  "Debentures").  The sole assets of the Trust are and will be
the  Debentures.  The  Debentures  are  redeemable,  in whole or in part, at the
Company's  option on or after December 1, 2002, at a redemption price of $25 per
Debenture  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  If  the  Company  redeems  the
Debentures, or upon maturity of the Debentures,  the Trust is required to redeem

NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies (continued)
- ----------------------------

Ford  guarantees to pay in full to the holders of the Preferred  Securities  all
distributions  and other payments on the Preferred  Securities to the extent not
paid by the Trust  only if and to the  extent  that  Ford has made a payment  of
interest or principal on the  Debentures.  This  guarantee,  when taken together
with Ford's  obligations under the Debentures and the indenture relating thereto
and its obligations  under the Declaration of Trust of the Trust,  including its
obligation  to pay certain  costs and expenses of the Trust,  constitutes a full
and  unconditional  guarantee  by  Ford of the  Trust's  obligations  under  the
Preferred Securities.

NOTE 2.  Discontinued Operation
- -------------------------------

On June 28, 2000,  Ford  distributed  130 million shares of Visteon  Corporation
("Visteon"),  which  represented  its  100%  ownership  interest,  by means of a
tax-free spin-off in the form of a dividend on Ford Common and Class B Stock.

Holders of Ford  Common and Class B Stock on the record date  received  0.130933
shares of Visteon common stock for each share of Ford stock, and participants in
U.S.  employee savings plans on the record date received $1.72 in cash per share
of Ford stock,  based on the  volume-weighted  average price of Visteon stock of
$13.1326  per  share on June  28,  2000.  The  total  value of the  distribution
(including  the $365  million  cash  dividend)  was $2.1  billion,  or $1.72 per
diluted share of Ford stock.

As a result of the spin-off of Visteon,  Ford recorded an after-tax loss of $2.3
billion in the second  quarter of 2000.  This loss  represents the excess of the
carrying  value of Ford's net  investment  in Visteon  over the market  value of
Visteon on the distribution date. Ford's financial statements reflect Visteon as
a  "discontinued  operation"  for all  periods  shown.  Through  the date of the
spin-off,  Visteon's net assets were  aggregated in Ford's balance sheet as "net
assets of discontinued operation".

In connection with the spin-off of Visteon, Ford and Visteon have entered into a
series of agreements  that provide for (i) certain hourly  employees  (numbering
approximately  24,000)  working for Visteon  that  remain Ford  employees,  with
Visteon reimbursing Ford for the expenses related thereto, (ii) Ford's retention
of  certain  pension  and  postretirement   benefit  obligations  for  qualified
employees that are or have worked for Visteon, (iii) predetermined pricing terms
for Visteon's products purchased by Ford through 2003, and (iv) reimbursement to
Ford for other post-spin  services provided to Visteon and tax activity incurred
on Visteon's behalf.

Visteon  revenues  included in  discontinued  operations  totaled $10.5 billion,
$19.4 billion,  and $17.8 billion for the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999,
and 1998, respectively.  Income from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2000,  1999, and 1998 is reported net of income tax expense of $182
million, $422 million, and $416 million, respectively.

NOTE 3.  Value Enhancement Plan
- -------------------------------

On  August  7,  2000,   the  Company   announced   the  final   results  of  its
recapitalization,  known as the Value  Enhancement Plan ("VEP").  Under the VEP,
Ford shareholders  exchanged each of their old Ford Common or Class B shares for
one new  Ford  Common  or Class B share,  as the  case  may be,  plus,  at their
election,  either $20 in cash,  0.748  additional new Ford Common  shares,  or a
combination of $5.17 in cash and 0.555  additional new Ford Common shares.  As a
result of the  elections  made by  shareholders  under the VEP,  the total  cash
elected  was $5.7  billion  and the total  number of new Ford Common and Class B
shares that became issued and outstanding was 1.893 billion.  As a result of the
VEP, approximately $1.2 billion was transferred from capital stock to capital in
excess of par value of stock.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, prior period shares
and earnings per share amounts were not adjusted. 2000 average diluted shares of
1.504 billion were  calculated  based on an average of 1.222 billion  shares for
the period prior to the VEP and an average of 1.9 billion  shares for the period
subsequent to the VEP.

NOTE 4.  Marketable and Other Securities
- ----------------------------------------

Trading  securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized  gains and losses
included in income.  Available-for-sale  securities  are  recorded at fair value
with  net  unrealized  gains  and  losses   reported,   net  of  tax,  in  other
comprehensive  income.  Held-to-maturity  securities  are  recorded at amortized
cost.  Equity  securities that do not have readily  determinable fair values are
recorded  at cost.  The basis of cost  used in  determining  realized  gains and
losses is specific identification.

The fair value of  substantially  all  securities is determined by quoted market
prices.  The estimated fair value of  securities,  for which there are no quoted
market  prices,  is based on similar types of securities  that are traded in the
market. Book value approximates fair value for all securities.

Expected  maturities of debt securities may differ from  contractual  maturities
because  borrowers  may have the  right to call or  prepay  obligations  with or
without penalty.

*Excludes certain diversified and other receivables of $482 million

Included in finance  receivables  at December  31, 2000 and 1999 were a total of
$2.2 billion and  $2.6 billion,  respectively,  owed by three customers with the
largest receivable  balances.  Other finance receivables  consisted primarily of
commercial and other collateralized loans and accrued interest. Also included in
other finance  receivables at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were  $3.5 billion  and
$3.7 billion,   respectively,   of  accounts  receivable  purchased  by  certain
Financial Services sector operations from Automotive sector operations.  Finance
receivables  that  originated  outside the United States are  $37.6 billion  and
$35.5 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Contractual   maturities  of  total  finance  receivables  are  as  follows  (in
millions): 2001 - $75,622; 2002 - $21,517; 2003 - $10,729; thereafter - $11,101.
Experience  indicates that a substantial  portion of the portfolio  generally is
repaid before the contractual maturity dates.

The fair value of most  receivables  was  estimated by  discounting  future cash
flows using an estimated discount rate that reflected the credit,  interest rate
and  prepayment  risks  associated  with  similar  types  of  instruments.   For
receivables with short maturities, the book value approximated fair value.

The Financial  Services  sector has sold  receivables  through  special  purpose
subsidiaries.  The  servicing  portfolio  related  to these  securitized  assets
amounted  to $28.4  billion  and $19.6  billion at  December 31, 2000  and 1999,
respectively.  The Company  retains  certain  beneficial  interests  in the sold
receivables  which are subject to limited recourse  provisions.  These financial
instruments of  $3.7 billion  at December 31, 2000 and  $3.4 billion at December
31, 1999 are included in other assets.

$176; thereafter - $300.

Depreciation  expense  for  assets  subject  to  operating  leases  is  provided
primarily  on the  straight-line  method  over the term of the lease in  amounts
necessary to reduce the carrying  amount of the asset to its estimated  residual
value.  Depreciation  rates and amounts are based on  assumptions as to used car
prices at lease  termination and the number of vehicles that will be returned to
the  Company.  Estimated  and actual  residual  values are reviewed on a regular
basis to  determine  whether  depreciation  amounts are  appropriate.  Gains and
losses upon  disposal of the assets also are included in  depreciation  expense.
Depreciation expense was as follows: $9.2 billion in 2000, $8.8 billion in 1999,
and $8.4 billion in 1998.

NOTE 7.  Allowance for Credit Losses
- ------------------------------------

An allowances  for credit losses is estimated and  established as required based
on  historical  experience  and other  factors that affect  collectibility.  The
allowance  for  estimated   credit  losses  includes  a  provision  for  certain
non-homogeneous impaired loans. Impaired loans are measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective  interest
rate. Finance receivables and lease investments are charged to the allowance for
credit  losses  when an  account  is deemed  to be  uncollectible,  taking  into
consideration  the  financial  condition  of  the  borrower,  the  value  of the
collateral,  recourse to  guarantors  and other  factors.  Recoveries on finance
receivables and lease  investments  previously  charged-off as uncollectible are
credited to the allowance for credit losses.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows (in millions):

Inventories  are  stated at the lower of cost or  market.  The cost of most U.S.
inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. The cost of
the remaining  inventories  is determined  primarily by the first-in,  first-out
("FIFO") method.

If the FIFO method had been used instead of the LIFO method,  inventories  would
have been higher by $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Property,  equipment,  and special  tools are stated at cost,  less  accumulated
depreciation and  amortization.  Property and equipment placed in service before
January 1, 1993 are  depreciated  using an  accelerated  method that  results in
accumulated  depreciation of  approximately  two-thirds of the asset cost during
the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset. Property and equipment
placed  in  service  after   December  31,  1992  are   depreciated   using  the
straight-line  method of  depreciation  over the  estimated  useful  life of the
asset. On average,  buildings and land  improvements are depreciated  based on a
30-year life;  machinery and equipment are depreciated  based on a 14-year life.
Costs  of  computer  software   developed  or  obtained  for  internal  use  are
capitalized  beginning  January 1, 1999.  Special tools placed in service before
January 1, 1999 are amortized  using an accelerated  method over periods of time
representing the estimated life of those tools.  Special tools placed in service
beginning in 1999 are amortized using the units-of-production method.

* Excludes non-taxable gain on spin-off of The Associates.

Deferred  taxes are  provided for  earnings of non-U.S.  subsidiaries  which are
planned to be remitted.  No provision  for deferred  taxes has been made on $2.0
billion of unremitted earnings (primarily prior to 1998) which are considered to
be  indefinitely  invested in non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  Deferred  taxes for these
unremitted earnings are not practical to estimate.

Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  reflect  the  estimated  tax  effect of
accumulated  temporary  differences between assets and liabilities for financial
reporting  purposes and those  amounts as measured by tax laws and  regulations.

Non-U.S.  net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were $3.6 billion at
December 31,  2000.  A  substantial  portion of these  losses has an  indefinite
carryforward  period;  the remaining  losses have expiration  dates beginning in
2001. The tax benefit of operating losses is recognized as a deferred tax asset,
subject to an appropriate  valuation  allowance.  Tax benefits of operating loss
carryforwards  are evaluated on an ongoing  basis.  Such  evaluations  include a
review of  historical  and  projected  future  operating  results,  the eligible
carryforward period, and other circumstances.

NOTE 12.  Employee Retirement Benefits
- --------------------------------------

Employee Retirement Plans
- -------------------------

The  Company  has two  principal  retirement  plans  in the  U.S.  The  Ford-UAW
Retirement Plan covers hourly employees  represented by the UAW, and the General
Retirement  Plan covers  substantially  all other Ford employees in the U.S. The
hourly plan provides  noncontributory  benefits related to employee service. The
salaried  plan  provides  similar  noncontributory   benefits  and  contributory
benefits related to pay and service.  Other U.S. and non-U.S.  subsidiaries have
separate  plans that  generally  provide  similar  types of  benefits  for their
employees.  Ford-UAW  Retirement Plan expense accruals for employees assigned to
Visteon are charged to Visteon.

In general, the Company's plans are funded, with the main exceptions of the U.S.
defined  benefit  plans for  executives  and certain  plans in Germany;  in such
cases, an unfunded liability is recorded.

The Company's policy for funded plans is to contribute  annually,  at a minimum,
amounts required by applicable laws,  regulations,  and union  agreements.  Plan
assets  consist  principally  of  investments in stocks and government and other
fixed income securities.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits
- ------------------------------------------------------

The Company and certain of its  subsidiaries  sponsor plans to provide  selected
health care and life  insurance  benefits for retired  employees.  The Company's
U.S.  and Canadian  employees  may become  eligible  for those  benefits if they
retire while working for the Company;  however,  benefits and eligibility  rules
may be modified  from time to time.  The  estimated  cost for these  benefits is
accrued over periods of employee  service on an  actuarially  determined  basis.
Postretirement  health  care and life  insurance  expense  accruals  for  hourly
employees assigned to Visteon and for salaried Visteon employees who met certain
age and service conditions at June 30, 2000 are charged to Visteon. A portion of
U.S.  hourly and salary  retiree  health and life  insurance  benefits  has been
prepaid.  At December 31, 2000,  the market value of this  pre-funding  was $3.1
billion, including $1.4 billion of assets contributed by Visteon to a segregated
trust.

NOTE 12.  Employee Retirement Benefits (continued)
- --------------------------------------

Increasing the assumed  health care cost trend rates by one percentage  point is
estimated to increase the aggregate  service and interest cost components of net
postretirement   benefit  expense  for  2000  by  about   $250 million  and  the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2000 by about $2.8
billion.  A decrease of one  percentage  point would reduce service and interest
costs by $195 million and decrease  the  December  31, 2000  obligation  by $2.3
billion.

*Postretirement health care and life insurance benefits

Postretirement  health care and life  insurance  obligations  increased  in 2000
primarily  as a result of  retention  of  obligations  previously  allocated  to
Visteon and higher than expected cost trends.

</TABLE>

Long-term  debt  at  December  31,  2000  included  maturities  as  follows  (in
millions):  2001 - $13,658; 2002 - $19,313; 2003 - $18,224; 2004 - $11,725; 2005
- - $15,904; thereafter - $21,952.

Included in  long-term  debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were  obligations  of
$53.7 billion  and  $46.5 billion,  respectively,  with fixed interest rates and
$33.4 billion and  $21.0 billion,  respectively,  with variable  interest  rates
(generally based on LIBOR or other  short-term  rates).  Obligations  payable in
foreign  currencies  at  December  31,  2000 and 1999 were  $33 billion  and $31
billion, respectively.  These obligations were issued primarily to fund non-U.S.
business operations.

Outstanding  commercial paper at December 31, 2000 totaled $42.3 billion at Ford
Credit and $2.3 billion at Hertz, with an average remaining  maturity of 35 days
and 18 days, respectively.

Agreements  to manage  exposures  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  include
primarily interest rate swap agreements.  At December 31, 2000, these agreements
decreased the weighted-average  interest rate on long-term debt to 6.7% compared
with 6.9% excluding these agreements,  and effectively decreased the obligations
subject  to  variable  interest  rates to $22.8  billion;  the  weighted-average
interest rate on  short-term  debt  excluding  these  agreements  did not change
materially.   At   December   31,   1999,   these   agreements   decreased   the
weighted-average  interest  rate on long-term  debt to 6.2%,  compared with 6.4%
excluding these agreements, and effectively decreased the obligations subject to
variable interest rates to $199 million; the  weighted-average  interest rate on
short-term debt excluding these agreements did not change materially.

Support Facilities
- ------------------

At December 31, 2000, Ford had long-term  contractually  committed global credit
agreements  under which  $8.4 billion  is available from various banks;  87% are
available through June 30, 2005. The entire  $8.4 billion may be used, at Ford's
option, by any affiliate of Ford; however, any borrowing by an affiliate will be
guaranteed by Ford.  Ford also has the ability to transfer,  on a  nonguaranteed
basis,  $8.1 billion of such credit lines in varying portions to Ford Credit and
FCE Bank plc.

At December 31, 2000, the Financial Services sector had a total of $27.7 billion
of  contractually  committed  support  facilities  (excluding  the $8.1  billion
available under Ford's global credit  agreements).  Of these  facilities,  $23.9
billion are  contractually  committed global credit agreements under which $19.3
billion  and $4.6  billion  are  available  to Ford  Credit  and FCE  Bank  plc,
respectively,  from various banks; 55% and 64%, respectively, of such facilities
are  available  through June 30, 2005.  The entire $19.3 billion may be used, at
Ford Credit's  option,  by any  subsidiary  of Ford Credit,  and the entire $4.6
billion may be used,  at FCE Bank plc's  option,  by any  subsidiary of FCE Bank
plc. Any  borrowings by such  subsidiaries  will be guaranteed by Ford Credit or
FCE Bank plc, as the case may be. At December 31, 2000, $173 million of the Ford
Credit global facilities were in use and $130 million of the FCE Bank plc global
facilities were in use. Other than the global credit  agreements,  the remaining
portion of the Financial Services Sector support facilities at December 31, 2000
consisted  of  $2.5  billion  of  contractually   committed  support  facilities
available  to Hertz in the U.S.  and  $1.3 billion  of  contractually  committed
support facilities available to various affiliates outside the U.S.; at December
31,  2000,   approximately  $0.9  billion  of  these  facilities  were  in  use.
Furthermore,  banks provide  $1.4 billion of liquidity facilities to support the
asset-backed commercial paper program of a Ford Credit sponsored special purpose
entity.

NOTE 14.  Capital Stock
- -----------------------

At December  31,  2000,  all general  voting  power was vested in the holders of
Common Stock and the holders of Class B Stock, voting together without regard to
class.  At that date,  the holders of Common Stock were entitled to one vote per
share and, in the aggregate, had 60% of the general voting power; the holders of
Class B Stock  were  entitled  to such  number of votes per share as would  give
them,  in the  aggregate,  the remaining  40% of the general  voting  power,  as
provided in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

The Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  provides that all shares of Common
Stock and  Class B Stock  share  equally  in  dividends  (other  than  dividends
declared with respect to any outstanding Preferred Stock), except that any stock
dividends  are payable in shares of Common Stock to holders of that class and in
Class B Stock to holders of that class. Upon liquidation,  subject to the rights
of any other class or series of stock having a preference on  liquidation,  each
share of  Common  Stock  will be  entitled  to the  first  $0.50  available  for
distribution to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, each share of Class B
Stock  will be  entitled  to the next $1.00 so  available,  each share of Common
Stock will be entitled to the next $0.50 so  available  and each share of Common
and Class B Stock will be entitled to an equal amount thereafter.

For a discussion of Ford's recapitalization effected in August 2000, see Note 3.

On  January 9,  1998,  all  outstanding  shares of Series A  Depositary  Shares,
representing  1/1,000 of a share of Series A  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred

equal to accrued and unpaid dividends.

Series B Depositary Shares,  representing  1/2,000 of a share of $1.00 par value
Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  have a liquidation  preference of $25 per

Depositary  Shares.  Dividends  are  payable at a rate of  $2.0625  per year per
Depositary  Share.  Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock is not convertible into
shares of Common Stock of the Company.  On and after  December 1, 2002, and upon
satisfaction  of certain  conditions,  the stock is  redeemable  for cash at the
option of Ford, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equivalent to $25 per
Depositary  Share,  plus an amount  equal to the sum of all  accrued  and unpaid
dividends.

In 1998, pursuant to an offer to purchase all Depositary Shares representing its
Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock at a price of $31.40 per Depositary  Share,
the Company purchased a total of 13,229,775 Depositary Shares.

The  Series B  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ranks  (and any  other  outstanding
Preferred  Stock of the Company would rank) senior to the Common Stock and Class
B Stock in respect of dividends and liquidation rights.

NOTE 15.  Stock Options
- -----------------------

The Company has stock options  outstanding  under the 1990  Long-Term  Incentive
Plan and the 1998  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan.  These Plans were approved by the
stockholders.  No further grants may be made under the 1990 Plan.  Grants may be
made under the 1998 Plan through April 2008. In general, options granted in 1997
under the 1990 Plan and subsequent years under the 1998 Plan become  exercisable
33%  after one year from the date of  grant,  66% after two  years,  and in full
after three years. In general, options granted prior to 1997 under the 1990 Plan
become  exercisable  25% after  one year  from the date of grant,  50% after two
years,  75% after three years,  and in full after four years.  Options under the
Plans expire after 10 years from the date of grant.  Certain  participants  were
granted  accompanying  Stock  Appreciation  Rights  under the Plans which may be
exercised in lieu of the related options.  Under the Plans, a Stock Appreciation
Right entitles the holder to receive,  without  payment,  the excess of the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the date of exercise  over the option price,
either  in  Common  Stock  or cash or a  combination.  In  addition,  grants  of
Performance/Contingent Stock Rights were made with respect to 1.2 million shares
in 2000,  1.2 million shares in 1999, and 1.4 million shares in 1998. The number
of shares ultimately  awarded will depend on the extent to which the performance
targets  specified  in each Right is  achieved,  individual  performance  of the
recipients,  and other factors,  as determined by the Compensation  Committee of
the Board of Directors.

Under the 1998 Plan,  up to 2% of Common  Stock  issued as of December 31 of any
year may be made  available  for stock options and other plan awards in the next
succeeding calendar year. That limit may be increased up to 3% in any year, with
a corresponding  reduction in shares  available for grants in future years.  Any
unused portion of the 2% limit for any calendar year may be carried  forward and
made   available   for  Plan   awards   in   succeeding   calendar   years.   At
December 31, 2000,  the number of unused shares  carried  forward  aggregated to
43.1 million shares.

          *Estimated fair value at date of grant adjusted
          for the Value Enhancement Plan.

The  Company  measures  compensation  cost  using the  intrinsic  value  method.
Accordingly,  and because option exercise price is set at fair value at the date
of  grant,  no  compensation  cost for stock  options  has been  recognized.  If
compensation  cost had been  determined  based on the  estimated  fair  value of
options  granted since 1995, the Company's net income and income per share would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

NOTE 16.  Litigation and Claims
- -------------------------------

Various  legal  actions,  governmental   investigations   and   proceedings  and
claims are pending or may be  instituted  or asserted in the future  against the
Company and its subsidiaries,  including those arising out of alleged defects in
the Company's products;  governmental  regulations relating to safety, emissions
and  fuel  economy;  financial  services;  employment-related  matters;  dealer,
supplier and other  contractual  relationships;  intellectual  property  rights;
product  warranties;  and  environmental  matters.  Certain of the pending legal
actions  are, or purport to be, class  actions.  Some of the  foregoing  matters
involve or may involve  compensatory,  punitive,  or  antitrust  or other treble
damage  claims  in  very  large  amounts,   or  demands  for  recall  campaigns,
environmental  remediation  programs,  sanctions,  or  other  relief  which,  if
granted, would require very large expenditures.

Litigation  is  subject  to  many  uncertainties,  and the outcome of individual
litigated  matters  is  not  predictable  with  assurance.  Reserves  have  been
established by the Company for certain of the matters discussed in the foregoing
paragraph where losses are deemed probable. It is reasonably possible,  however,
that some of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph for which reserves
have not been  established  could be decided  unfavorably  to the Company or the
subsidiary  involved  and could  require the Company or such  subsidiary  to pay
damages or make other  expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot
be estimated at December 31, 2000. The Company does not reasonably expect, based
on its  analysis,  that such  matters  would  have a  material  effect on future
consolidated  financial  statements  for a  particular  year,  although  such an
outcome is possible.

NOTE 17.  Commitments and Contingencies
- ---------------------------------------

At December 31, 2000, the Company had the following  minimum rental  commitments
under non-cancelable  operating leases (in millions):  2001 - $678; 2002 - $543;
2003 - $421; 2004 - $284; 2005 - $203;  thereafter - $798. These amounts include
rental  commitments  related to the sale and  leaseback  of  certain  Automotive
sector machinery and equipment. Rental expense for all operating leases was $873
million in 2000; $847 million in 1999; and $747 million in 1998.

NOTE 18.  Financial Instruments
- -------------------------------

Estimated  fair  value  amounts  have been  determined  using  available  market
information and various  valuation  methods depending on the type of instrument.
In evaluating the fair value information,  considerable  judgment is required to
interpret  the market data used to develop the  estimates.  The use of different
market  assumptions  and/or different  valuation  techniques may have a material
effect on the estimated  fair value  amounts.  Further,  it should be noted that
fair value at a particular  point in time gives no  indication of future gain or
loss, or what the dimensions of that gain or loss are likely to be.

Counterparty Credit Risk
- ------------------------

Ford manages its foreign  currency,  interest rate,  and commodity  counterparty
credit risks by limiting  exposure to and by monitoring the financial  condition
of each  counterparty.  The  amount  of  exposure  Ford  may  have  to a  single
counterparty on a worldwide basis is limited by company policy.  In the unlikely
event  that a  counterparty  fails to meet  the  terms  of a  foreign  currency,
interest  rate, or commodity  instrument,  the Company's  risk is limited to the
fair value of the instrument.

NOTE 19.  Acquisitions, Dispositions and Restructurings
- -------------------------------------------------------

Automotive Sector
- -----------------

Acquisitions
- ------------

     Purchase of Land Rover Business - On June 30, 2000, Ford purchased the Land
     Rover  business  from  the  BMW  Group  for  approximately   $2.6  billion.
     Approximately two-thirds of the purchase price was paid at time of closing;
     the remainder will be paid in 2005 (Note 11). The acquisition  involves the
     entire Land Rover line of products,  and related  assembly and  engineering
     facilities. It does not include Rover's passenger car business or financial
     services business.

     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase.  The assets acquired,
     liabilities  assumed,  and the  results  of  operations  since  the date of
     acquisition are included in Ford's  financial  statements on a consolidated
     basis.

     The purchase price for Land Rover has been allocated to the assets acquired
     and  liabilities  assumed  based  on the  estimated  fair  value  as of the
     acquisition  date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
     value of net assets  acquired is  approximately  $775  million and is being
     amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over 40  years.  Value  assigned  to
     identified  intangible  assets is  approximately  $275 million and is being
     amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 8 to 40 years.
     The  purchase  price  allocation  included a write-up of  inventory to fair
     value;  the sale of this inventory in the third quarter of 2000 resulted in
     a one-time increase in cost of sales of $106 million after tax.

     Assuming the Land Rover  acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2000 and
     1999, Ford's total  (Automotive and Financial  Services) pro forma revenue,
     net income,  and earnings  per share for the years ended  December 31, 2000
     and 1999 would not have been materially affected.

     Purchase of AB Volvo's Worldwide  Passenger Car Business ("Volvo Car") - On
     March 31, 1999,  Ford purchased Volvo Car for approximately  $6.45 billion.
     The  acquisition  price  consisted  of a cash payment of  approximately  $2
     billion on March 31, 1999,  a deferred  payment  obligation  to AB Volvo of
     approximately  $1.6 billion  due March 31,  2001 (Note  11),  and Volvo Car
     automotive net indebtedness of approximately $2.9 billion.  Most automotive
     indebtedness was repaid on April 12, 1999.

     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The assets purchased,
     liabilities  assumed,  and the  results  of  operations  since  the date of
     acquisition  are included in our  financial  statements  on a  consolidated
     basis.

     The purchase price for Volvo Car has been allocated to the assets  acquired
     and  liabilities  assumed  based on the  estimated  fair  values  as of the
     acquisition  date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
     value of net assets  acquired is  approximately  $2.5  billion and is being
     amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over 40  years.  Value  assigned  to
     identified  intangible  assets is  approximately  $400 million and is being
     amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over  periods  ranging  from 12 to 40
     years.  The purchase price  allocation  included a write-up of inventory to
     fair  value;  the sale of this  inventory  in the  second  quarter  of 1999
     resulted in a one-time increase in cost of sales of $146 million after-tax.

     Purchase of Kwik-Fit  Holdings plc - During the third quarter of 1999, Ford
     completed  the  purchase  of all the  outstanding  stock  of  Kwik-Fit  plc
     ("Kwik-Fit").  At the  time,  Kwik-Fit  was  Europe's  largest  independent
     vehicle  maintenance  and light repair  chain.  The  acquisition  price was
     approximately  $1.6 billion and consisted of cash payments of approximately
     $1.4  billion  and  loan  notes  to  certain   Kwik-Fit   shareholders   of
     approximately $200 million,  redeemable  beginning on April 30, 2000 and on
     any subsequent interest payment date.

     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The assets purchased,
     liabilities  assumed, and the results of operations since June 30, 1999 are
     included in our financial statements on a consolidated basis.

NOTE 19.  Acquisitions, Dispositions and Restructurings (continued)
- -------------------------------------------------------

     The purchase price for Kwik-Fit has been  allocated to the assets  acquired
     and  liabilities  assumed  based on the  estimated  fair  values  as of the
     acquisition  date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
     value of the net assets acquired is approximately $1.1 billion and is being
     amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over 30  years.  Value  assigned  to
     identified  intangible  assets is  approximately  $400 million and is being
     amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over  periods  ranging  from 10 to 30
     years.

     Assuming the Volvo Car and Kwik-Fit acquisitions had taken place on January
     1, 1999 and 1998,  Ford's total  (Automotive  and  Financial  Services) pro
     forma  revenue,  net  income,  and  earnings  per share for the years ended
     December 31, 1999 and 1998 would not have been materially affected.

European Charges
- ----------------

Following an extensive  business review of the Ford brand Automotive  operations
in Europe,  the Company recorded a pre-tax charge in Automotive cost of sales of
$1.6 billion in the second  quarter of 2000.  This charge  included $1.1 billion
for asset  impairments and $468 million for  restructuring  costs. The effect on
after-tax  earnings was $1 billion.  As of December  31, 2000,  we have spent or
utilized approximately $150 million related to the restructuring charge.

The asset impairment  charge,  attributable to excess capacity related to Ford's
performance in the competitive and regulatory  environment in Europe,  reflected
the write-down of certain  long-lived  assets from their carrying value to their
estimated fair value,  as determined by an  independent  valuation of Ford brand
Automotive operations in Europe.

The restructuring  charge included employee separation costs of $426 million and
other  exit-related  costs  of  $42  million.  Employee  separation  included  a
workforce  reduction of about 3,300  employees  (2,900  hourly and 400 salaried)
related to the planned  cessation of vehicle  production at the Dagenham  (U.K.)
Body and Assembly Plant

Nemak Joint Venture
- -------------------

During the  fourth  quarter of 2000,  Ford  recorded  in cost of sales a pre-tax
charge of $205 million  ($133  million  after  taxes)  related to the fair value
transfer of its Windsor  Aluminum Plant,  Essex Aluminum Plant,  and its Casting
Process  Development  Center for an increased equity interest in its Nemak Joint
Venture.  The new joint  venture is reflected in Ford's  consolidated  financial
statements on an equity basis.

Dissolution of AutoEuropa Joint Venture
- ---------------------------------------

Effective  January 1, 1999,  Ford's joint venture for the production of minivans
with Volkswagen AG in Portugal  (AutoEuropa)  was dissolved  resulting in a $255
million  pre-tax gain ($165 million  after taxes).  The gain was recorded in the
first quarter 1999 and credited to cost of sales.

Write-Down of Kia Motors Corporation
- ------------------------------------

During  the  fourth  quarter of 1998,  Ford  recorded  a pre-tax  charge of $111
million  ($86 million  after taxes) to write-off  its net exposure to Kia Motors
Corporation.  The  write-off  of Ford's  exposure was recorded in cost of sales.
Ford's share of Mazda Motor Corporation's exposure was recorded in equity in net
income of affiliated companies.

Batavia/ZF Friedrichshafen AG Joint Venture
- -------------------------------------------

During the  fourth  quarter of 1998,  Ford  recorded  in cost of sales a pre-tax
charge of $112  million  ($73  million  after  taxes)  related to the fair value
transfer of its Batavia (Ohio) Transmission Plant to a new joint venture company
formed  by Ford and ZF  Friedrichshafen  AG of  Germany.  The joint  venture  is
reflected in Ford's consolidated financial statements on an equity basis.

- -------------------------------------------------------

Restructurings
- --------------

Ford recorded a pre-tax charge of $688 million ($447 million after taxes) in the
fourth quarter of 1998,  reflecting  retirement and separation  program  actions
that  were  completed  during  1998  and  1999.  These  special   voluntary  and
involuntary  programs  reduced the  workforce by 1,947  persons in North America
(all  salaried),  1,951 in Europe  (1,304  hourly and 647 salaried) and 4,650 in
South America (4,400 hourly and 250 salaried).  The costs were primarily charged
to the Automotive sector.

Financial Services Sector
- -------------------------

Associates First Capital Corporation ("The Associates")
- -------------------------------------------------------

During the second  quarter of 1998,  the Company  completed a spin-off of Ford's
80.7% (279.5  million  shares)  interest in The  Associates.  As a result of the
spin-off of The Associates, Ford recorded a gain of $15,955 million in the first
quarter of 1998 based on the fair value of The Associates as of the record date,
March 12,  1998.  The  spin-off  qualified  as a tax-free  transaction  for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

                        Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ford Motor Company:

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of Ford Motor Company
and  Subsidiaries  at  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  These financial statements are the responsibility
of the  Company's  management;  our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
United  States of America,  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies
- ----------------------------

Description of Business
- -----------------------

Ford Capital BV and its  subsidiaries are engaged in the importation and sale of
vehicles  and parts in the markets of Belgium,  Denmark,  Finland,  Netherlands,
Norway and Poland. A subsidiary company which produced vehicles in Poland ceased
manufacturing operations during 2000.

Principles of Consolidation
- ---------------------------

The consolidated  financial statements include all majority-owned  subsidiaries.
Use of estimates and  assumptions as determined by management is required in the
preparation of  consolidated  financial  statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates
and assumptions. The functional currency of Ford Capital BV is U.S. dollars. For
purposes of Notes to Financial  Statements,  "the Company" means Ford Capital BV
and its  majority-owned  consolidated  subsidiaries  unless the context requires
otherwise.  Certain amounts for prior periods are reclassified,  if required, to
conform to present period presentations.

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------

Sales are recorded by the Company when products are shipped to dealers and other
customers,  except  as  described  below.  Estimated  costs for  approved  sales
incentive  programs  normally are recognized as sales  reductions at the time of
revenue  recognition.  Estimated  costs for sales  incentive  programs  approved
subsequent to the time that related sales were recorded are recognized  when the
programs are approved.

Sales through dealers to certain daily rental companies,  where the daily rental
company has an option to require the Company to repurchase  vehicles  subject to
certain conditions,  are recognized over the period of daily rental service in a
manner  similar  to lease  accounting.  The  carrying  value of these  vehicles,
included in other current  assets,  was $24 million at December 31, 2000 and $26
million at December 31, 1999.

Other Costs
- -----------

Advertising  and sales  promotion  costs are expensed as  incurred.  Advertising
costs were $65 million in 2000, $58 million in 1999 and $44 million in 1998.

Estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale.

Derivative Financial Instruments
- --------------------------------

The  Company  uses  derivative  financial  instruments  to  manage  exposure  to
fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  All  derivative  financial  instruments  are
classified  as  "held  for  purposes   other  than   trading";   company  policy
specifically   prohibits  the  use  of  leveraged  derivatives  or  use  of  any
derivatives for speculative purposes.

The Company has two  long-term  receivable  instruments  with Ford Motor Company
that are denominated in British pounds and two long-term debt obligations to the
public market denominated in U.S. dollars.  The Company purchased cross currency
pound-to-dollar swaps to offset the exchange exposure. Terms of the swaps mirror
those contained in the receivable instruments.

Statement  of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging" will be adopted on January 1, 2001. Based on
present  interpretation of this new standard, the Company estimates that it will
record a transition  adjustment that will reduce 2001 other comprehensive income
by $63 million.

NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies (continued)
- ----------------------------

Foreign Currency Translation
- ----------------------------

Assets  and  liabilities  of  subsidiaries  are  translated  to U.S.  dollars at
end-of-period  exchange rates.  The effects of this  translation are reported in
other comprehensive income. Remeasurement of assets and liabilities of locations
that use the U.S. dollar as their functional  currency are included in income as
transaction  gains and losses.  Income  statement  elements of subsidiaries  are
translated to U.S. dollars at  average-period  exchange rates.  Also included in
income are gains and losses arising from transactions  denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency of the entity involved. Net transaction gains
and losses, as described above, decreased net income by $19 million in 2000, $25
million in 1999, and $4 million in 1998

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Certain Identifiable Intangibles
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment on
an ongoing basis. Such evaluations  compare operating income before amortization
of  goodwill  to the  amortization  recorded  for the  operations  to which  the
goodwill relates. The Company also periodically  evaluates the carrying value of
long-lived  assets  and  long-lived  assets  to be  disposed  of  for  potential
impairment.  The Company  considers  projected  future operating  results,  cash
flows, trends, and other circumstances in making such estimates and evaluations.

Goodwill
- --------

Goodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets of acquired companies and is amortized using the straight-line method
for a period  of 20 years.  Total  goodwill  included  in other  assets  was $14
million at December 31, 2000 and $2 million at December 31, 1999.

</TABLE>

Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.
Property and equipment  placed in service before January 1, 1993 are depreciated
using  an  accelerated  method  that  results  in  accumulated  depreciation  of
approximately  two-thirds  of the  asset  cost  during  the  first  half  of the
estimated  useful life of the asset.  Property and  equipment  placed in service
after  December  31,  1992 are  depreciated  using the  straight-line  method of
depreciation over the estimated useful life of the asset. On average,  buildings
and land  improvements  are  depreciated  based on a  30-year  life.  Furniture,
fixtures  and  equipment  are  depreciated  based on lives  ranging from 8 to 14
years.

Long-term  debt at  December  31,  2000 and 1999  were  obligations  with  fixed
interest rates and is guaranteed by Ford Motor Company.  Obligations  payable in
foreign  currencies  at  December 31,  2000 were $17 million and at December 31,
1999  were  $183  million.  There  are no  agreements  to  manage  exposures  to
fluctuations in interest rates. Maturities of the long-term debt are as follows:
2001 - $550 million; 2002 - $400 million; 2010 - $500 million.

NOTE 9.  Capital Stock and Contributions
- ----------------------------------------

On January 1, 1998,  887,532  shares with a par value of $593 were issued out of
the 1,000,000 authorized.

On October 12, 1998,  the  authorized  share capital was reduced from  1,000,000
shares of par value $593 to 255,140 shares of par values $593 and 643,000 shares
of par value $133 each. At the same time, the Company made a capital  redemption
of $259 million to Ford Motor Company.

In 2000, the Company  received a non-cash  capital  contribution  of $72 million
from Ford Motor Company (Note 13).


NOTE 10.  Litigation and Claims
- -------------------------------

In the normal course of business, various legal actions,  proceedings and claims
are made against the Company,  including those arising out of alleged defects in
the products  sold by the Company,  in  contractual  disputes and  environmental
matters.  Litigation  is  subject  to many  uncertainties,  and the  outcome  of
individual  litigated  matters is not predictable with assurance.  Reserves have
been  established  by the Company for certain of these  matters where losses are
deemed probable.

In addition, the Company has made offers to purchase the minority shares of Ford
Motor  Company  AS in  Denmark  and  Oy  Ford  Ab in  Finland.  Certain  of  the
shareholders are disputing the price offered.  In Denmark the Court has stated a
valuation  of the  Company and a share  price,  which all  relevant  parties are
considering.  In  Finland  a formal  valuation  of the Court of  Arbitration  is
awaited.

The Company does not reasonably expect, based on its analysis,  that any adverse
outcome from such matters  would have a material  effect on future  consolidated
financial  statements  for a  particular  year,  although  such  an  outcome  is
possible.

NOTE 12.  Financial Instruments
- -------------------------------

Estimated  fair  value  amounts  have been  determined  using  available  market
information and various  valuation  methods depending on the type of instrument.
In evaluating the fair value information,  considerable  judgment is required to
interpret  the market data used to develop the  estimates.  The use of different
market  assumptions  and/or different  valuation  techniques may have a material
effect on the estimated  fair value  amounts.  Further,  it should be noted that
fair value at a particular  point in time gives no  indication of future gain or
loss, or what the dimensions of that gain or loss are likely to be.

Foreign Currency Instruments
- ----------------------------

The fair value of foreign  currency  instruments  was  estimated  using  current
market rates  provided by outside  quotation  services.  The estimated  notional
amount and fair value of the Company's  currency products at December 31 were as
follows (in millions):

Counterparty Credit Risk
- ------------------------

Ford manages its foreign currency by limiting  exposure to and by monitoring the
financial  condition of each counterparty.  The amount of exposure Ford may have
to a single  counterparty on a worldwide basis is limited by company policy.  In
the  unlikely  event  that a  counterparty  fails to meet the terms of a foreign
currency, the Company's risk is limited to the fair value of the instrument.

NOTE 13.  Acquisitions and Restructuring
- ----------------------------------------

Acquisition of Ford Finland
- ---------------------------
In March 2000,  Ford Motor Company  transferred  984,469 shares of Ford Finland,
representing its 91.2% ownership interest, to Ford Capital BV. Ford Capital BV's
share of net  assets at the date of  transfer  was $72  million  which  reflects
historical cost. Ford Finland's results and financial  condition are included in
Ford Capital BV's financial statements on a consolidated basis.

Minority Shareholdings Buy-out
- ------------------------------
During  2000,  Ford  Capital BV acquired  (for a total price of $21 million) the
Common Stock of Ford Finland and Ford  Belgium that it did not  previously  own,
which  represented  approximately  8.8%  and  15.8% of the  economic  interests,
respectively.   Additionally,   the  Company  began  to  acquire  the  11.3%  of
outstanding  Common  Stock of Ford  Denmark  that it did not already  own. As of
December 31, 2000, Ford Capital BV owned  approximately 99.2% of the outstanding
Common Stock of Ford  Denmark.  As a result of these  acquisitions,  the Company
recorded approximately $12 million of goodwill, which is being amortized over 20
years.

Closure of Plonsk Manufacturing Plant
- -------------------------------------
In July 2000,  Ford of Poland,  a  subsidiary  of the Company,  ceased  assembly
operations  in its Plonsk Plant.  The related  closure cost charged to income in
2000 was $8 million.

dependencies  of the United States,  in the District of Columbia,  and in any or
all foreign countries.

     The  objects  and  purposes  of the  corporation  amended  herein  shall be
construed as powers as well as objects and purposes and their enumeration herein
shall not be deemed to exclude, by inference or otherwise,  any power, object or
purpose which the  corporation  is empowered to exercise,  whether  expressly or

FOURTH. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the corporation
shall have authority to issue is 6,560,117,376 shares,  consisting of 30,000,000
shares  of  Preferred  Stock  of the  par  value  of One  Dollar  ($1.00)  each,
530,117,376  shares of Class B Stock of the par value of One Cent ($0.01)  each,
and  6,000,000,000  shares of Common  Stock of the par value of One Cent ($0.01)
each.

     The  following  is a statement of all of the  designations  and the powers,
preferences  and rights,  and the  qualifications,  limitations or  restrictions
thereof, of the three classes of the stock of the corporation:


                                   SECTION 1.

                            VOTING POWERS AND RIGHTS.

     1.1. Generally. All rights to vote and all voting power (including, without
limitation  thereto,  the right to elect directors) shall be vested exclusively,
in accordance with the provisions of subsections 1.1 through 1.7, inclusive,  in
the holders of Class B Stock and the holders of Common  Stock,  voting  together
without  regard  to  class,  all  except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  by
subsection  1.7 or by the Board of Directors  pursuant to  subsection  9.1 or as
otherwise expressly required by the law of the State of Delaware.

     1.2.  Common  Stock.  At every meeting of the  stockholders  each holder of
Common  Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock held by
him.

     1.3.  Class B Stock.  At every meeting of the  stockholders  each holder of
Class B Stock  shall be  entitled,  for each share of such stock held by him, to
such number of votes  (which may be or include a fraction of a vote) as shall be
determined  in accordance  with the  provisions of this  subsection  1.3,  which
number of votes, so determined from time to time, is hereinafter  referred to as
the "Class B voting power per share."

          1.3a. 40% of Total Voting Power. Until the total number of outstanding
     shares of Class B Stock  shall  first  fall below  60,749,880,  the Class B
     voting power per share shall be the quotient  derived by dividing the total
     number  of  outstanding  shares  of Class B Stock  into a  number  equal to
     two-thirds  of the  aggregate  number of votes  which  could be cast by the
     holders of all of the outstanding  shares of (i) Common Stock and (ii) Full
     Voting Preferred Stock (as defined in subsection 9.2), if any, if they were
     present at the meeting.

          1.3b.  30% of Total  Voting  Power.  From and  after the time when the
     total number of outstanding  shares of Class B Stock shall first fall below
     60,749,880  and until such number  shall first fall below  33,749,932,  the
     Class B voting  power per share shall be the  quotient  derived by dividing
     the total number of outstanding shares of Class B Stock into a number equal
     to  three-sevenths  of the aggregate number of votes which could be cast by
     the holders of all of the  outstanding  shares of (i) Common Stock and (ii)
     Full Voting Preferred Stock, if any, if they were present at the meeting.

                                       3

<PAGE>

          1.3c.  One Vote per Share Voting  Power.  From and after the time when
     the total  number of  outstanding  shares of Class B Stock shall first fall
     below 33,749,932,  the Class B voting power per share shall be one vote per
     share.

          1.3d.  Computations.  The quotients referred to in this subsection 1.3
     shall be computed to the nearest  one-thousandth of a vote (or, if there be
     no nearest  one-thousandth,  shall be  computed  to a  ten-thousandth  of a
     vote).

     1.4. No Cumulative Voting. No stockholder shall be entitled to exercise any
right of cumulative  voting.  If, however,  any  stockholder  should at any time
become  entitled to exercise a right of  cumulative  voting,  whether by express
requirement  of the law of the  State  of  Delaware  or  otherwise,  then at all
elections  of  directors  each holder of Class B Stock shall be entitled to cast
for each share of Class B Stock held by him a number of votes equal to the Class
B voting power per share then  exercisable  (computed as provided in  subsection
1.3),  each  holder of Common  Stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each
share of Common  Stock held by him,  and each  holder of Full  Voting  Preferred
Stock,  if any,  of any  series  shall be  entitled  to cast the number of votes
(which  may be one vote or more or less than one  vote)  for each  share of Full
Voting  Preferred  Stock  held by him which the Board of  Directors  shall  have
determined pursuant to subsection 9.1 in establishing voting rights with respect
to such  series,  in each  case  multiplied  by the  number of  directors  to be
elected,  and each such holder  shall be entitled to cast all of his votes for a
single  director or to distribute them among the number of directors to be voted
for, or to cast his votes for any two or more of them as he may see fit.

     1.5. Quorum.  At any meeting of stockholders,  the presence in person or by
proxy of the  holders of shares  entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes
(computed, in the case of each share of Class B Stock, as provided in subsection
1.3)  which  could  be  cast  at  such  meeting  by  the  holders  of all of the
outstanding shares of stock of the corporation  entitled to vote on every matter
that is to be voted on without regard to class at such meeting shall  constitute
a quorum.

     1.6.  Manner of Voting.  At every meeting of  stockholders,  the holders of
Class B Stock,  the  holders  of Common  Stock and the  holders  of Full  Voting
Preferred Stock, if any, shall vote together, without regard to class, and their
votes  (computed,  in the case of each share of Class B Stock,  as  provided  in
subsection 1.3) shall be counted and totalled together;  and at any meeting duly
called and held at which a quorum  (determined in accordance with the provisions
of subsection 1.5) is present, a majority of the votes (computed, in the case of
each share of Class B Stock,  as provided in subsection 1.3) which could be cast
at such meeting upon a given  question by such holders who are present in person
or by proxy shall be necessary, in addition to any vote or other action that may
be expressly  required by the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or
by the law of the State of Delaware,  to decide such question,  and shall decide
such question if no such additional vote or other action is so required.

     1.7.  Class  Vote  by  Class  B  Stock.  Notwithstanding  any of the  other
provisions of this Section 1, the corporation  shall not, until the total number
of outstanding  shares of Class B Stock shall first fall below 33,749,932,  take
any of the following  actions except with the affirmative vote of the holders of

                   OWNERSHIP AND CONVERSION OF CLASS B STOCK.

     2.1.  Ownership  of Class B Stock.  Until the time when the total number of
outstanding  shares of Class B Stock shall first fall below 33,749,932,  holders
of shares of such stock may (i) sell or otherwise  dispose of or transfer any or
all of the shares of such stock held by them, respectively,  only to persons who

(ii)  convert  any or all of such  shares  into  shares of Common  Stock for the
purpose of effecting the sale or  disposition  of such shares of Common Stock to
any person as provided in  subsection  2.3.  Until such time,  no one other than
those  persons in whose names shares of Class B Stock become  registered  on the
original stock ledger of the corporation by reason of their record  ownership of
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the corporation  which
are  reclassified  into shares of Class B Stock,  or  transferees  or successive
transferees  who at the time of transfer meet such  qualifications  set forth in
subsection  2.2, shall by virtue of the  acquisition of a certificate for shares
of Class B Stock  have the  status  of an owner or  holder  of shares of Class B
Stock or be recognized as such by the  corporation  or be otherwise  entitled to
enjoy for his own benefit the special rights and powers of a holder of shares of
Class B Stock.

     From and  after the time when the  total  number of  outstanding  shares of
Class B Stock shall first fall below 33,749,932, holders of shares of such stock
may (i) sell or  otherwise  dispose of or transfer  such shares to any person or
(ii) convert such shares into shares of Common Stock for any purpose as provided
in  subsection  2.4, and any person may have the status of an owner or holder of
shares of Class B Stock.

     Holders of shares of Class B Stock may at any and all times transfer to any
person the shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of such shares of
Class B Stock.

     2.2. Transfers of Class B Stock on Corporate Books. Shares of Class B Stock
shall be  transferred  on the  books of the  corporation  and a new  certificate
therefor  issued,  upon  presentation  at the  office  of the  Secretary  of the
corporation (or at such  additional  place or places as may from time to time be
designated by the Secretary or any Assistant  Secretary of the  corporation)  of
the certificate for such shares,  in proper form for transfer and accompanied by
all  requisite  stock  transfer  tax stamps,  only if such  certificate  when so
presented shall also be accompanied by an affidavit of the record holder of such
shares stating that such  certificate is being presented to effect a transfer of
such shares to any one or more of the following:

          (i) a natural person who meets the qualification that he is either (A)
     a natural person in whose name shares of Class B Stock became registered on
     the  original  stock  ledger of the  corporation  by  reason of his  record
     ownership  of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the
     corporation  which were

                                      5

<PAGE>

     reclassified  into shares of Class B Stock, or (B) a descendant  (including
     any descendant by adoption and any descendant of an adopted  descendant) of
     a natural  person in whose name shares of Class B Stock were so  registered
     by reason of such record ownership,  or (C) a spouse or surviving spouse of
     a natural person who is or was while living  included within the provisions
     of either of the foregoing subclauses (A) or (B); or

          (ii)  any  two  or  more  natural  persons  each  of  whom  meets  the
     qualification set forth in clause (i) next above; or

          (iii) a  transferee  as trustee  of a trust,  created by deed or will,
     which trust meets the following  requirements:  (1) the income thereof from
     the date of  transfer  to such  trustee  shall be required to be paid to or
     applied for the use and benefit of or  accumulated  for one or more natural
     persons,  concurrently or  successively,  all of whom meet or will meet the
     qualification  set forth in clause (i) above, and no other persons,  except
     for such  portion of the  income as is payable to or to be applied  for the
     use and benefit of or accumulated for one or more (A) other

natural persons during terms not to exceed their respective  lives,  who, though
they do not meet the  qualification set forth in clause (i) above, are relatives
of or are or were  employees  or  dependents  of natural  persons  meeting  such
qualification,  or (B) exempt  organizations  (as defined in subsection 2.7) for
terms not exceeding 33 years from the date of the commencement of the trust, and
except for such accumulated  income as may be required to be paid over to others
upon the death of the person for whom it was accumulated,  and (2) the principal
thereof shall be required to be transferred, assigned and paid over upon failure
or termination  of the interests in the income thereof  referred to in subclause
(1) above;  provided,  however, that if the provisions of such trust relating to
the  disposition  of income or principal are subject to amendment in such manner
that the trust could be changed to a trust not meeting the  requirements of this
clause (iii),  the trustee  thereof,  as such, shall have entered into a written
agreement with the corporation  providing that if such trust shall be amended at
any time prior to the time when the total number of outstanding  shares of Class
B Stock shall first fall below  33,749,932 such trustee will promptly deliver to
the  corporation  a copy,  duly  certified by such  trustee,  of the  instrument
effecting  such  amendment and will,  unless such trust as so amended then meets
the requirements of this clause (iii),  promptly  surrender the certificates for
the  shares of Class B Stock  then held in such  trust  for  conversion  of such
shares into an equal number of shares of Common Stock in the manner set forth in
subsection 3.1; or

          (iv) a stock corporation  (hereinafter  called a "corporate  holder"),
     not less than 75% of the number of outstanding  shares of each class of the
     capital stock (other than shares of non-voting  preferred  stock as defined
     in subsection 2.7) of which shall, at the time at which the certificate for
     shares of Class B Stock is presented  for transfer,  be owned  beneficially
     and of record by natural  persons who meet the  qualification  set forth in
     clause (i) above  (provided  that the same natural  person need not be both
     the beneficial and the record owner), or be owned of record by trustees (or
     successor  trustees)  of trusts  which meet the  requirements  set forth in
     clause (iii) above,  or be so owned in part by such natural  persons and so
     owned in part by such trustees (or  successor  trustees);  which  corporate
     holder shall have entered into a written  agreement  with this  corporation
     providing  that if, at any time prior to the time when the total  number of
     outstanding shares of Class B Stock shall first fall below 33,749,932, less
     than 75% of the number of  outstanding  shares of each class of the capital
     stock  (other  than  shares of  non-voting  preferred  stock as  defined in
     subsection  2.7) of such  corporate  holder  shall be so  owned,  then such
     corporate  holder will either  promptly  (A) transfer the shares of Class B
     Stock then held by it to one or more  persons  who at the time of  transfer
     meet the  qualifications  set forth in clause (i), (ii), (iii),  (iv), (v),
     (vi) or (vii) of subsection 2.2 and cause the  certificates  therefor to be
     duly presented for transfer into the name of such person or persons, or (B)
     surrender the  certificates for such shares of Class B Stock for conversion
     of such  shares  into an equal  number of shares  of Common  Stock,  in the
     manner set forth in subsection  3.1, or (C) transfer some of such shares as
     provided in the foregoing  subclause (A) and surrender the certificates for
     the  remainder of such shares for  conversion  as provided in the foregoing
     subclause (B); or

          (v) a legatee  under the will of any  stockholder  of the  corporation
     deceased prior to the effective date of the reclassification of the Class A
     Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock of the  corporation  into Class A
     Stock,  Class B Stock and Common Stock,  such  transfer  being made for the
     purpose of  satisfying,  in any manner  permitted by such will,  all or any
     part of the claim of the said  legatee  in  respect to a legacy of any kind
     under said will; provided,  however, that the aggregate number of shares of
     Class B Stock  transferred  pursuant  to this  clause  (v) shall not exceed
     8,437,480; or

                                      6

<PAGE>

          (vi) a transferee as successor  trustee or as co-trustee of a trust of
     which his immediate  transferor was or is a trustee  registered as a record
     holder of such shares of Class B Stock as  permitted by the  provisions  of
     subsection  2.1;  provided,  however,  that if the proviso in clause  (iii)
     above is applicable such successor trustee or co-trustee shall have entered
     into a written  agreement  with the  corporation  whereby  he  assumes  the
     obligations of the agreement required by said clause (iii); or

          (vii) the  corporation  for the purpose of retirement  pursuant to the
     provisions of subsection 3.3;

and if the  certificate  for such  shares of Class B Stock  when  presented  for
transfer shall also be accompanied

          (a) in the case of a transfer  to a  transferee  as trustee of a trust
     which meets the  requirements  set forth in clause (iii) above,  by copies,
     duly certified by such trustee,  of the instrument  creating such trust and
     of all amendments thereto, and by an original counterpart or certified copy
     of any agreement required by said clause (iii), or

          (b) in the case of a  transfer  to a  corporate  holder as  defined in
     clause  (iv)  above,  by a copy,  duly  certified  by the  Secretary  or an
     Assistant   Secretary  of  such  corporate  holder,  of  the  list  of  its
     stockholders and their  respective  holdings as shown on its stock books at
     the time at which the  certificate for shares of Class B Stock is presented
     for  transfer,  and by an original  counterpart  or  certified  copy of the
     agreement referred to in said clause (iv), or

          (c) in the case of a  transfer  to a legatee  described  in clause (v)
     above, by a copy of the will of the deceased stockholder, duly certified by
     the clerk of the court in which the same shall have been probated, or

          (d) in the case of a transfer to a transferee as successor  trustee or
     co-trustee as permitted by clause (vi) above, by an original counterpart or
     certified copy of any agreement of such transferee  required by said clause
     (vi).

     From and  after the time when the  total  number of  outstanding  shares of
Class B Stock shall first fall below  33,749,932,  shares of Class B Stock shall
be transferable to any person without regard to the foregoing provisions of this
subsection 2.2.

     2.3.  Conversion  of  Class  B  Stock  for the  Purpose  of  Sale or  Other
Disposition. A record holder of shares of Class B Stock shall be entitled at any
time and from time to time to convert any or all of such shares held by him into
the same number of shares of Common Stock in the manner set forth in  subsection
3.1, for the purpose of effecting the sale or other  disposition  of such shares
of Common Stock, by surrendering certificates representing the shares of Class B
Stock to be converted, in proper form for transfer of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such  conversion and  accompanied by all stock transfer tax stamps
requisite for such  transfer,  and also  accompanied by a written notice by such
record  holder to the  corporation  stating that such record  holder  desires to
convert  such  shares of Class B Stock into the same  number of shares of Common
Stock for the purpose of the sale or other  disposition of such shares of Common
Stock and  requesting  that the  corporation  issue all of such shares of Common
Stock to persons (other than such record  holder) named  therein,  setting forth
the  number of shares of Common  Stock to be issued to each such  person and the
denominations  in which the  certificates  therefor are to be issued.  Each such
notice shall be signed by the record  holder (or in an  appropriate  case by his
guardian, committee, executor, administrator or other legal representative).

     If a record  holder of shares of Class B Stock shall  deliver a certificate
for such shares, endorsed by him for transfer or accompanied by an instrument of
transfer  signed by him,  to a person who does not meet the  qualifications  set
forth in clause (i), (ii),  (iii),  (iv),  (v), (vi) or (vii) of subsection 2.2,
then such person or any successive transferee of such certificate may treat such
endorsement or instrument as authorizing  him on behalf of such record holder to
convert such shares in the manner above provided for the purpose of the transfer
to himself of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such  conversion,  and to
give on behalf of such record  holder the  written  notice of  conversion  above
required, and may convert such shares of Class B Stock accordingly.

                                      7

<PAGE>

     If such shares of Class B Stock shall  improperly  have been  registered in
the name of such a person (or in the name of any  successive  transferee of such
certificate) and a new certificate  therefor  issued,  such person or transferee
may surrender such new certificate for cancellation,  accompanied by the written
notice of conversion above required, in which case (A) such person or transferee
shall be deemed to have elected to treat the  endorsement  on (or  instrument of
transfer accompanying) the certificate so delivered by such former record holder
as authorizing  such person or transferee on behalf of such former record holder
so to convert such shares and so to give such notice,  (B) the shares of Class B
Stock  registered  in the name of such former  record  holder shall be deemed to
have been  surrendered  for  conversion  for the purpose of the transfer to such
person or transferee of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, and
(C) the  appropriate  entries shall be made on the books of the  corporation  to
reflect such action.

     2.4.  Ultimate  Convertibility  of Class B Stock for Any Purpose.  From and
after  the time when the total  number  of  outstanding  shares of Class B Stock
shall  first fall below  33,749,932,  (i) each  record  holder of shares of such
stock may convert  such shares into an equal  number of shares of Common  Stock,
irrespective of the purpose of such conversion, by surrendering the certificates
for  such  shares  in the  manner  set  forth  in  subsection  3.1;  and (ii) no
additional  shares of Class B Stock shall be issued by the corporation,  and the
corporation  shall promptly after such time take such appropriate  action as may
be necessary to reduce the  authorized  amount of Class B Stock to the number of
shares then outstanding.

     2.5. Legend on Certificates for Class B Stock. Every certificate for shares
of Class B Stock shall bear a legend on the face thereof reading as follows:

          "The shares of Class B Stock  represented by this  certificate may not
     be transferred to any person who does not meet the qualifications set forth
     in clause (i), (ii),  (iii),  (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of subsection 2.2 of
     Article FOURTH of the Certificate of  Incorporation  of this corporation as
     amended (Sections 1 to 10 of said Article FOURTH being set forth in full on
     the  reverse  hereof)  and no person  who does not meet the  qualifications
     prescribed by subsection  2.1 of said Article  FOURTH is entitled to own or
     to be  registered  as the  record  holder of such  shares of Class B Stock,
     until the time referred to in said subsection 2.1, but the record holder of
     this  certificate may at any time convert such shares of Class B Stock into
     the same number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of effecting  the
     sale or other  disposition  of such  shares of Common  Stock to any person.
     Each holder of this certificate,  by accepting the same, accepts and agrees
     to all of the foregoing." Any certificate for shares of Class B Stock which
     shall be issued after the time when the total number of outstanding  shares
     of Class B Stock  shall  first  fall below  33,749,932  shall not bear such
     legend.

     2.6.  Violations of Subsections 2.1 and 2.2. In the event that the Board of
Directors of the corporation (or any committee of the Board of Directors, or any
officer  of  the  corporation,  designated  for  the  purpose  by the  Board  of
Directors)  shall  determine,  upon  the  basis of facts  not  disclosed  in any
affidavit or other document  accompanying  the certificate for shares of Class B
Stock when  presented for transfer,  that such shares of Class B Stock have been
registered in violation of the  provisions  of  subsection  2.1 or 2.2, or shall
determine  that a person is enjoying for his own benefit the special  rights and
powers of  shares of Class B Stock in  violation  of such  provisions,  then the
corporation  shall take such action at law or in equity as is appropriate  under
the circumstances.  An unforeclosed pledge made to secure a bona fide obligation
shall not be deemed to violate such provisions.

     2.7.  Definitions;  Verification  of  Affidavits.  For the purposes of this
Section 2, each  reference  to a "person"  shall be deemed to include not only a
natural person, but also a corporation, partnership, association, unincorporated
organization or legal entity of any kind;  each reference to a "natural  person"
(or to a "record  holder" of  shares,  if a natural  person)  shall be deemed to
include  in  his  representative  capacity  a  guardian,  committee,   executor,
administrator  or other legal  representative  of such natural  person or record
holder; the term "non-voting preferred stock" as applied to stock in a corporate
holder,  shall mean stock which does not entitle the holder  thereto to vote for
the  election  of  directors  under any  circumstances  and  carries no right to
dividends  or interest in earnings  other than the right to dividends in a fixed
amount  per  annum,  which  right  may  be  cumulative;

                                      8

<PAGE>

and the term "exempt organization" shall mean any corporation,  community chest,
fund or foundation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable,
scientific, literary, or educational purposes which, at the date of verification
of the affidavit in which reference thereto is made, shall have been exempted or
be exempt, wholly or partially,  from taxation on income under the provisions of
Section  501(c)(3) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as then in effect,  or
other  provision  of Federal law then in effect  governing  the  exemption  from
Federal  taxation on income of institutions  organized and operated  exclusively
for any one or more of the foregoing purposes. Each affidavit of a record holder
furnished  pursuant to subsection 2.2 shall be verified as of a date not earlier
than five days prior to the date of  delivery  thereof,  and,  where such record
holder is a corporation or  partnership,  shall be verified by an officer of the
corporation or by a general partner of the partnership, as the case may be.


                                   SECTION 3.

                 GENERAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONVERSIONS.

     3.1. Manner of Effecting Conversions.  Each conversion of shares of Class B
Stock into shares of Common Stock made  pursuant to the  provisions of Section 2
shall be effected by the surrender of the certificate representing the shares to
be  converted  at the office of the  Secretary  of the  corporation  (or at such
additional  place  or  places  as may  from  time to time be  designated  by the
Secretary  or any  Assistant  Secretary  of the  corporation)  in such  form and
accompanied by such notice,  affidavits,  other documents and stock transfer tax
stamps,  if any, as may be  prescribed  by and shall comply with the  applicable
provisions  of Section  2, and upon such  surrender  the  record  holder of such
shares (or, in the case of a conversion  made for the purpose of  effecting  the
sale, gift or other

disposition  of the shares of Common Stock  issuable upon such  conversion,  the
person named in the prescribed notice) shall be entitled to become, and shall be
registered in the original stock ledger of the corporation as, the record holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion,  and each
such share of Class B Stock shall be converted  into one share of Common  Stock,
as the Common  Stock shall then be  constituted,  and  thereupon  there shall be
issued and delivered to such record  holder or other named  person,  as the case
may be,  promptly at such office or other  designated  place,  a certificate  or
certificates for such number of shares of Common Stock.

     3.2. Dividends.  Upon any conversion of shares of Class B Stock into shares
of Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 2, any dividend, for which
the record  date shall be  subsequent  to such  conversion,  which may have been
declared  on the  shares of Class B Stock so  converted  shall be deemed to have
been declared,  and shall be payable, with respect to the shares of Common Stock
into or for which such shares of Class B Stock shall have been so converted, and
any such  dividend  which shall have been  declared  on such  shares  payable in
shares of Class B Stock  shall be deemed  to have  been  declared,  and shall be
payable, in shares of Common Stock.

     3.3.  Prohibition  against  Reissue.  The corporation  shall not reissue or
resell any shares of Class B Stock which shall have been  converted  into shares
of Common Stock  pursuant to or as permitted by the  provisions of Section 2, or
any shares of Class B Stock which shall have been acquired by the corporation in
any  other  manner.  The  corporation  shall,  from  time  to  time,  take  such
appropriate  action as may be  necessary to retire such shares and to reduce the
authorized amount of Class B Stock accordingly.

     3.4.  Reservation  of  Common  Stock.  The  corporation  shall at all times
reserve and keep  available,  out of its authorized  but unissued  Common Stock,
such  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock as would  become  issuable  upon the
conversion of all shares of Class B Stock then outstanding.

     3.5.  Investigation of Facts. In connection with any transfer or conversion
of any stock of the corporation pursuant to or as permitted by the provisions of
Section  2 of this  Article  FOURTH,  or in  connection  with the  making of any
determination referred to in subsection 2.6,

          (i)  the  corporation  shall  be  under  no  obligation  to  make  any
     investigation  of  facts  unless  an  officer,  employee  or  agent  of the
     corporation  responsible  for making  such  transfer  or  determination  or
     issuing Common

                                       9

<PAGE>

     Stock pursuant to such  conversion has  substantial  reason to believe,  or
     unless the Board of  Directors  (or a committee  of the Board of  Directors
     designated for the purpose)  determines that there is substantial reason to
     believe, that any affidavit or other document is incomplete or incorrect in
     a material respect or that an investigation would disclose facts upon which
     any  determination  referred to in subsection 2.6 should be made, in either
     of which  events  the  corporation  shall  make or  cause  to be made  such
     investigation  as it may deem  necessary or desirable in the  circumstances
     and have a reasonable time to complete such investigation, and

          (ii) neither the  corporation nor any director,  officer,  employee or
     agent of the corporation shall be liable in any manner for any action taken
     or omitted in good faith.

                                   SECTION 4.

                              SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS.

     4.1.  Special Right of  Subscription -- Class B Stock. No shares of Class B
Stock and no  obligations  or shares  convertible  into shares of Class B Stock,
whether now or hereafter  authorized  and whether  unissued or in the  treasury,
shall be issued, for money paid, property or any other consideration, unless the
holders  of  Class B Stock  shall  first  have  been  given a  special  right to
subscribe  thereto,  on a ratable basis, at a price not less favorable than that
at which such  shares or  obligations  are to be offered to others.

     4.2. Other Subscription Rights Denied.  Except for the special subscription
rights  conferred  on  the  holders  of  Class  B  Stock  by the  provisions  of
subsections  4.1 and 4.3,  no  holder of stock of the  corporation  of any class
shall have any pre-emptive or preferential right to subscribe to or purchase any
shares  of any  class of  stock of the  corporation,  whether  now or  hereafter
authorized  and  whether  unissued  or  in  the  treasury,  or  any  obligations

convertible  into shares of any class of stock of the  corporation,  at any time
issued or sold, or any right to subscribe to or purchase any thereof.

     4.3.  Discretionary  Offering of Common Stock. If the Board of Directors in
its discretion should at any time offer shares of Common Stock, or any shares or
obligations  convertible  into  shares  of Common  Stock,  for  subscription  or
purchase by the holders of Common  Stock,  then there shall be offered to all of
the holders of Class B Stock for  subscription  or purchase on a ratable  basis,
and at the same  price per  share or unit,  shares  of stock of that  class,  or
shares or  obligations  convertible  into shares of stock of that class,  as the
case may be;  provided,  however,  that  from and  after the time when the total
number of  outstanding  shares of Class B Stock shall  first have  fallen  below
33,749,932,  there shall be offered to the holders of the outstanding  shares of
such stock for  subscription  or  purchase  shares of Common  Stock or shares or
obligations convertible into shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, in lieu
of additional shares of Class B Stock or shares or obligations  convertible into
shares of Class B Stock, as the case may be.


                                   SECTION 5.

                              RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS.

     When and as dividends  are declared  (other than  dividends  declared  with
respect to Preferred  Stock),  whether payable in cash, in property or in shares
of  stock of the  corporation  (other  than  shares  of Class B Stock or  Common
Stock),  the holders of Class B Stock and the  holders of Common  Stock shall be
entitled to share  equally,  share for share,  in such  dividends.  No dividends
shall be  declared  or paid in shares  of Class B Stock or  Common  Stock of the
corporation,  except dividends,  otherwise ratable, payable in shares of Class B
Stock to  holders  of that  class of stock,  and in  shares  of Common  Stock to
holders of that class of stock; provided,  however, that from and after the time
when the total  number of  outstanding  shares of Class B Stock shall first have
fallen below  33,749,932,  any such  dividend  shall be declared and paid to the
holders of shares of Class B Stock in shares of Common Stock.

                                  ADJUSTMENTS.

     6.1. Increase in Outstanding  Stock. If the corporation shall in any manner
increase  the number of  outstanding  shares of Class B Stock,  then each of the
share  numbers set forth in the Table below and  appearing  in the  provision of
this Article  FOURTH set forth in such Table opposite such share number shall be
deemed to be increased  by a number  bearing the same  proportion  to such share
number that such increase in the number of  outstanding  shares of Class B Stock
bears to the number of shares of Class B Stock outstanding  immediately prior to
such increase;  and in each such case all of such provisions and this subsection
6.1 shall be applied so as to give effect to such share numbers as so increased.
If any such  increase  shall be  effected by  amendment  of the  Certificate  of
Incorporation, then such amendment shall itself increase each of the appropriate
share numbers in accordance with the foregoing.

     6.2.  Consolidation  or Combination  of Shares.  If the  corporation  shall
effect the  consolidation  or combination of all  outstanding  shares of Class B
Stock by  amendment of the  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  so as to reduce the
number of outstanding  shares  thereof,  then such amendment shall also decrease
each of the share numbers set forth in the Table in subsection 6.1 and appearing
in the  provision of this Article  FOURTH set forth in such Table  opposite such
share number,  by a number bearing the same proportion to such share number that
the decrease in the number of outstanding shares of stock of such class effected
by such  consolidation or combination  bears to the number of shares of stock of
such  class  outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  such
consolidation or combination.

                                   SECTION 7.

                         CLASS B STOCK UPON DISSOLUTION.


     Subject  to the  rights  of the  holders  of  shares of any class or series
ranking  prior to or on a parity with the Common Stock or the Class B Stock,  as
the case may be, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation,
in the event of any  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary:  (i) before any payment or distribution of the
assets of the corporation  (whether  capital or surplus) shall be

                                       11

<PAGE>

made to or set apart for the holders of Class B Stock, the holders of the shares
of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive  $0.50 per share (the "Common Stock
Initial Liquidation Amount"); (ii) before any additional payment or distribution
of the assets of the corporation  (whether  capital or surplus) shall be made to
or set apart for the holders of Common Stock following the payment of the Common
Stock Initial Liquidation Amount, the holders of Class B Stock shall be entitled
to receive $1.00 per share (the "Class B Liquidation Amount");  and (iii) before
any additional payment or distribution of the assets of the corporation (whether
capital  or  surplus)  shall be made to or set apart for the  holders of Class B
Stock  following the payment of the Class B Liquidation  Amount,  the holders of
Common  Stock shall be entitled to receive  $0.50 per share (the  "Common  Stock
Additional  Liquidation  Amount" and,  together  with the Common  Stock  Initial
Liquidation  Amount,  the "Common  Stock  Liquidation  Amount").  Following  the
payment or setting apart for payment of the Common Stock Liquidation  Amount and
the Class B  Liquidation  Amount,  the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock
shall  participate  pari passu and be entitled to receive,  on a pro rata basis,
the remaining  assets of the  corporation  or proceeds  therefrom  available for
distribution  to the  holders of Common  Stock and Class B Stock.  If,  upon any
liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up of the  corporation,  the assets of the
corporation  or proceeds  thereof:  (i)  distributable  among the holders of the
shares of Common  Stock shall be  insufficient  to pay in full the Common  Stock
Initial Liquidation Amount and liquidating payments on any other shares of stock
ranking,  as to  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding  up, on a parity with the
Common Stock, then such assets,  or the proceeds  thereof,  shall be distributed
among the holders of shares of Common Stock and any such other stock  ratably in
accordance with the respective  amounts which would be payable on such shares of
Common Stock and any such other stock if all amounts  payable  thereon were paid
in full;  (ii)  distributable  among the  holders of the shares of Class B Stock
shall  be  insufficient  to pay in full  the  Class  B  Liquidation  Amount  and
liquidating  payments on any other shares of stock ranking,  as to  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, on a parity with the Class B Stock, then such assets,
or the proceeds  thereof,  shall be  distributed  among the holders of shares of
Class B Stock and any such other stock ratably in accordance with the respective
amounts  which  would be  payable  on such  shares of Class B Stock and any such
other  stock  if  all  amounts  payable   thereon  were  paid  in  full;   (iii)
distributable  among  the  holders  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock  shall  be
insufficient to pay in full the Common Stock Additional  Liquidation  Amount and
liquidating  payments on any other shares of stock ranking,  as to  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, on a parity with the Common Stock,  then such assets,
or the proceeds  thereof,  shall be  distributed  among the holders of shares of
Common Stock and any such other stock ratably in accordance  with the respective
amounts which would be payable on such shares of Common Stock and any such other
stock if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this
Section 7, (i) a  consolidation  or merger of the  corporation  with one or more
corporations,  (ii) a sale  or  transfer  of  all  or  substantially  all of the
corporation's  assets or (iii) a statutory share exchange shall not be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.

                                   SECTION 8.

                           ALL SHARES OTHERWISE EQUAL.

     Except as herein otherwise expressly provided,  shares of Class B Stock and
Common  Stock  shall  all be of equal  rank and shall all  entitle  the  holders
thereof to the same rights and privileges.

                                   SECTION 9.

                                PREFERRED STOCK.

     9.1. Preferred Stock.  Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to

Preferred Stock, to fix by resolution or resolutions  providing for the issue of
any series the number of shares  included  in such  series and the  designation,
relative powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications,  limitations or
restrictions of such series.  Pursuant to the foregoing general authority vested
in the Board of Directors,  but (except as provided in the proviso to clause (v)
of this subsection  9.1) not in limitation of the powers  conferred on the Board
of  Directors  thereby  and by the law of the  State of  Delaware,  the Board of
Directors is expressly  authorized  to determine  with respect to each series of
Preferred Stock:

                                      12

<PAGE>

          (i) the  distinctive  designation  of such  series  and the  number of
     shares  (which  number from time to time may be  decreased  by the Board of
     Directors, but not below the number of such shares then outstanding, or may
     be  increased  by the  Board of  Directors  unless  otherwise  provided  in
     creating such series)  constituting such series;

          (ii) the rate and time at which,  and the  preferences  and conditions
     under  which,  dividends  shall be  payable on shares of such  series,  the
     status of such  dividends as  cumulative,  or  non-cumulative,  the date or
     dates from which dividends, if cumulative, shall accumulate, and the status
     of such shares as participating or  non-participating  after the payment of
     dividends as to which such shares are entitled to any preference;

          (iii) the  right,  if any,  of  holders  of  shares of such  series to
     convert such shares  into,  or to exchange  such shares for,  shares of any
     other class or classes  (other than Class B) or of any other  series of the
     same class, the prices or rates of conversion or exchange,  and adjustments
     thereto,  and any other terms and conditions  applicable to such conversion
     or exchange;

          (iv) the rights and  preferences,  if any, of the holders of shares of
     such series upon the liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the affairs
     of, or upon any  distribution  of the  assets of,  the  corporation,  which
     amount may vary depending upon whether such  liquidation,  dissolution,  or
     winding up is  voluntary or  involuntary,  and, if  voluntary,  may vary at
     different   dates,  and  the  status  of  the  shares  of  such  series  as
     participating  or  non-participating  after  the  satisfaction  of any such
     rights and preferences;

          (v) the voting powers, if any, of the holders of shares of such series
     which may,  without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  include (A)
     the general right to one vote (or more or less than one vote) per share on
     every matter  (including,  without  limitation,  the election of directors)
     voted on by the  stockholders  without  regard to class and (B) the limited
     right to vote,  as a series by  itself or  together  with  other  series of
     Preferred  Stock or together with all series of Preferred Stock as a class,
     upon such matters, under such circumstances and upon such conditions as the
     Board of  Directors  may fix,  including,  without  limitation,  the right,
     voting as a series by itself or  together  with other  series of  Preferred
     Stock or together with all series of Preferred  Stock as a class,  to elect
     one or more directors of the corporation in the event there shall have been
     a  default  in the  payment  of  dividends  on any  one or more  series  of
     Preferred Stock; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the provisions of
     the preceding  subclause (B) or any other provisions of this subsection 9.1
     to  the  contrary,  the  holders  of  Preferred  Stock,  considered  in the
     aggregate  (whether  voting by  individual  series or  together  with other
     series of Preferred Stock or together with all series of Preferred Stock as
     a  class),  shall  not have  the  right to a  separate  class  vote for the
     election of one or more  directors of the  corporation  except in the event
     there shall have been a default in the payment of  dividends  on any one or
     more series of Preferred Stock and, in such event, shall not have the right
     to a separate class vote for more than a total of two directors;

        (vi) the times,  terms and  conditions,  if any,  upon which shares of
     such series shall be subject to redemption,  including the amount which the
     holders  of  shares  of such  series  shall be  entitled  to  receive  upon
     redemption  (which  amount  may  vary  under  different  conditions  or  at
     different redemption dates) and the amount, terms, conditions and manner of
     operation of any  purchase,  retirement  or sinking fund to be provided for
     the shares of such series;

          (vii)  the  limitations,  if any,  applicable  while  such  series  is
     outstanding on the payment of dividends or making of  distributions  on, or
     the  acquisition  or  redemption  of,  Common Stock or Class B Stock or any
     other  class of  shares  ranking  junior,  either as to  dividends  or upon
     liquidation, to the shares of such series;

          (viii) the conditions or  restrictions,  if any, upon the issue of any
     additional shares (including  additional shares of such series or any other
     class)  ranking  on a parity  with or prior to the  shares  of such  series
     either as to dividends or upon liquidation; and

          (ix)  any  other  relative  powers,   preferences  and  participating,
     optional or other special rights,  and the  qualifications,  limitations or
     restrictions thereof, of shares of such series;

                                      13

<PAGE>

     in  each  case,  so far as not  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of the
     Certificate  of  Incorporation  or the law of the  State of  Delaware.  All
     shares of Preferred Stock shall be identical and of equal rank except as to
     the  particulars  that may be fixed by the Board of  Directors  as provided
     above,  and all shares of each series of Preferred Stock shall be identical
     and of equal rank except as to the dates from which  cumulative  dividends,
     if any, thereon shall be cumulative.

     9.2. Full Voting Preferred Stock. As used in this Article FOURTH,  the term
"Full  Voting  Preferred  Stock" shall mean  Preferred  Stock of any one or more
series  the  holders  of  which  shall  be  entitled  to  vote on  every  matter
(including,  without  limitation,  the  election of  directors)  voted on by the
stockholders without regard to class.

                                   SECTION 10.

determining  the right to vote at any meeting of  stockholders  or of a class of
stockholders,  the original  stock ledger of the  corporation as at the close of
business  on the record date fixed for such  meeting  or, if the stock  transfer
books of the  corporation  shall  have  been  closed  for a  period  immediately
preceding the date of such meeting, then as at the close of business on the date

     (3)  Dividends.  (a) The holders of shares of the Series B Preferred  Stock
shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors
out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends at the rate per annum of
$4,125 per share of Series B Preferred Stock. Such dividends shall be cumulative
from the Issue  Date,  whether or not in any  Dividend  Period or Periods  there
shall be funds of the  corporation  legally  available  for the  payment of such
dividends, and shall be payable quarterly, when, as and if declared by the Board
of Directors,  on the first Business Day of March, June,  September and December

of twelve  30-day  months  and a  360-day  year.  Holders  of

                                     15

between a dividend payment record date and the respective  Dividend Payment Date
shall not be entitled to receive the dividend  payable on such Dividend  Payment
Date. Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any
dividends,  whether payable in cash,  property or stock, in excess of cumulative
dividends,  as herein provided, on the Series B Preferred Stock. No interest, or
sum of money in lieu of  interest,  shall be payable in respect of any  dividend
payment or payments on the Series B Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.

     (c) So long as any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are  outstanding,
no  dividends,  except as described in the next  succeeding  sentence,  shall be
declared or paid or set apart for payment on any class or series of stock of the
corporation  ranking,  as to dividends,  on a parity with the Series B Preferred
Stock,   for  any  period  unless  full   cumulative   dividends  have  been  or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment  thereof set apart for such payment on the Series B Preferred  Stock for
all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full
cumulative  dividends.  When  dividends are not paid in full or a sum sufficient
for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, upon the shares of the Series B
Preferred Stock and any other class or series of stock ranking on a parity as to
dividends with the Series B Preferred Stock, all dividends  declared upon shares
of the Series B Preferred Stock and all dividends declared upon such other stock
shall be declared pro rata so that the amounts of dividends  per share  declared
on the Series B Preferred  Stock and such other stock shall in all cases bear to
each other the same ratio that accrued  dividends per share on the shares of the
Series B Preferred Stock and such other stock bear to each other.

     (d) So long as any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are  outstanding,
no  dividends  (other  than  dividends  or  distributions  paid in shares of, or
options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock,
Class B Stock or other stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred  Stock, as
to dividends  and upon  liquidation)  shall be declared or paid or set apart for
payment or other  distribution  declared or made upon the Common Stock,  Class B
Stock or any other  stock of the  corporation  ranking  junior  to the  Series B
Preferred Stock, as to dividends or upon liquidation nor shall any Common Stock,
nor any Class B Stock nor any other such stock of the corporation ranking junior
to the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock,  as to  dividends  or upon  liquidation  be
redeemed,  purchased or otherwise  acquired for any consideration (or any moneys
be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares
of any such stock) by the corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for
stock of the corporation  ranking junior to the Series B Preferred  Stock, as to
dividends and upon  liquidation)  unless,  in each case (i) the full  cumulative
dividends  on all  outstanding  shares of the Series B  Preferred  Stock and any
other stock of the  corporation  ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred
Stock, as to dividends or upon liquidation shall have been paid or set apart for
payment for all past Dividend  Periods and dividend periods with respect to such
other stock and (ii) sufficient  funds shall have been set apart for the payment
of the  dividend  for the current  Dividend  Period with respect to the Series B
Preferred  Stock and the dividend  period with respect to any other stock of the
corporation  ranking  on a parity  with  the  Series B  Preferred  Stock,  as to
dividends or upon liquidation.

     (4)  Liquidation   Preference.   (a)  In  the  event  of  any  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation,  whether voluntary or involuntary,
before any payment or  distribution  of the assets of the  corporation  (whether
capital  or  surplus)  shall be made to or set apart for the  holders  of Common
Stock,  Class B Stock or any other  series or class or  classes  of stock of the
corporation  ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock,  upon  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, the holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
shall be  entitled  to receive  $50,000  per share  plus an amount  equal to all
dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and accumulated and unpaid
thereon to the date of final  distribution  to such  holders;  but such  holders
shall  not be  entitled  to any  further  payment.  If,  upon  any  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation,  the assets of the corporation, or
proceeds  thereof,  distributable  among the  holders  of the shares of Series B
Preferred  Stock shall be insufficient  to pay in full the  preferential  amount
aforesaid and liquidating  payments on any other shares of stock ranking,  as to

liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, on a parity with the Series B Preferred
Stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the
holders of shares of Series B Preferred  Stock and any such other stock  ratably
in accordance with the respective  amounts which would be payable on such shares
of Series B  Preferred  Stock and any such other  stock if all  amounts  payable
thereon  were  paid  in  full.  For the  purposes  of this  Section  (4),  (i) a
consolidation or merger of the corporation with one or more corporations, (ii) a
sale or transfer of

                                      16

<PAGE>

all or substantially all of the corporation's  assets or (iii) a statutory share
exchange  shall not be deemed to be a  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up,
voluntary or involuntary.

     (b)  Subject to the rights of the  holders of shares of any series or class
or classes  of stock  ranking  on a parity  with or prior to Series B  Preferred
Stock,  upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding  up,  upon any  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation, after payment shall have been made
in full to the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock, as provided in this Section
(4),  any other series or class or classes of stock  ranking  junior to Series B
Preferred Stock, upon liquidation,  dissolution or winding up shall,  subject to
the respective  terms and provisions (if any) applying  thereto,  be entitled to
receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed,  and the holders
of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.

     (5)  Redemption  at the Option of the  Corporation.  (a) Series B Preferred
Stock may not be redeemed by the  corporation  prior to December 1, 2002,  on or
after which the corporation,  at its option, may, subject to the next succeeding
paragraph,  redeem the shares of Series B Preferred  Stock, in whole or in part,
out of funds  legally  available  therefor,  at any  time or from  time to time,
subject to the notice provisions and provisions for partial redemption described
below,  at a  redemption  price of $50,000  per share,  plus an amount  equal to
accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date fixed for redemption,  whether
or not earned or declared.

     In addition to any other  requirement for or condition to the redemption of
the Series B Preferred  Stock set forth in this  Section  (5),  the  corporation
shall not redeem any shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
(5)(a) unless within the two-year period ending on the date fixed for redemption
the corporation shall have issued sufficient shares of Common Stock to result in
receipt by the  corporation  of net proceeds from such issuances of an aggregate
amount at least equal to the aggregate  liquidation  preference of the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock proposed to be redeemed.

     (b) In the event that full  cumulative  dividends on the Series B Preferred
Stock and any other class or series of stock of the corporation  ranking,  as to
dividends,  on a parity with the Series B Preferred  Stock have not been paid or
declared  and set apart for  payment,  the Series B  Preferred  Stock may not be
redeemed  in part and the  corporation  may not  purchase  or acquire  shares of
Series B  Preferred  Stock or such other  stock  otherwise  than  pursuant  to a
purchase  or  exchange  offer made on the same terms to all holders of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and such other stock.

     (c) In the event the corporation  shall redeem shares of Series B Preferred
Stock,  notice of such  redemption  shall be given by first class mail,  postage
prepaid,  mailed not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the  redemption
date,  to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed,  at such  holder's
address as the same appears on the stock records of the  corporation.  Each such
notice shall state:  (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series
B Preferred  Stock to be redeemed  and, if less than all the shares held by such
holder are to be  redeemed,  the number of such shares to be redeemed  from such
holder; (3) the redemption price; (4) the place or places where certificates for
such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption  price;  and (5)
that  dividends  on the  shares  to be  redeemed  shall  cease to accrue on such
redemption  date.  Notice  having been mailed as  aforesaid,  from and after the
redemption  date (unless  default shall be made by the  corporation in providing
money for the payment of the redemption  price),  (i) dividends on the shares of
the Series B  Preferred  Stock so called for  redemption  shall cease to accrue,
(ii) said  shares  shall no longer  be deemed to be  outstanding,  and (iii) all
rights of the holders thereof as  stockholders  of the  corporation  (except the
right to receive from the  corporation  the  redemption  price without  interest
thereon)  shall  cease.  The  corporation's  obligation  to  provide  moneys  in
accordance  with the  preceding  sentence  shall be deemed  fulfilled  if, on or
before the redemption  date, the corporation  shall deposit with a bank or trust
company (which may be an affiliate of the  corporation)  having an office in the
Borough of Manhattan,  City of New York,  and having a capital and surplus of at
least  $50,000,000,   funds  necessary  for  such  redemption,  in  trust,  with
irrevocable  instructions  that such funds be applied to the  redemption  of the
shares of  Series B  Preferred  Stock so called  for  redemption.  Any  interest
accrued on such funds shall be paid to the  corporation  from time to time.  Any
funds so deposited  and  unclaimed at the end of two years from such  redemption
date shall be released or repaid to the corporation, after which, subject to any
applicable laws relating to escheat or

                                       17

<PAGE>

unclaimed  property,  the holder or holders of such shares of Series B Preferred
Stock so called for redemption shall look only to the corporation for payment of
the redemption price.

     Upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the  certificates  for any
such shares so redeemed  (properly  endorsed or assigned  for  transfer,  if the
Board of Directors shall so require and the notice shall so state),  such shares
shall  be  redeemed  by the  corporation  at  the  applicable  redemption  price
aforesaid.  If fewer than all the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock
are to be redeemed,  shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the  corporation
from  outstanding  shares of Series B Preferred Stock not previously  called for
redemption  by lot or pro  rata (as  nearly  as may be) or by any  other  method
determined by the corporation in its sole  discretion to be equitable.  If fewer
than  all  the  shares  represented  by  any  certificate  are  redeemed,  a new
certificate  shall be issued  representing the unredeemed shares without cost to
the holder thereof.

     (6) Shares to be Retired.  All shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased
or  redeemed  by the  corporation  shall be retired  and  canceled  and shall be
restored to the status of  authorized  but unissued  shares of preferred  stock,
without designation as to series.

     (7)  Ranking.  Any class or  classes of stock of the  corporation  shall be
deemed to rank:

          (i) prior to the Series B Preferred  Stock,  as to  dividends or as to
     distribution of assets upon liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, if the
     holders of such class shall be entitled to the receipt of  dividends  or of
     amounts  distributable upon liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, as the
     case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series B Preferred
     Stock;

          (ii) on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock, as to dividends or
     as to distribution of assets upon  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up,
     whether or not the dividend rates,  dividend payment dates or redemption or
     liquidation  prices per share thereof be different from those of the Series
     B Preferred  Stock,  if the holders of such class of stock and the Series B
     Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts
     distributable upon liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, as the case may
     be, in  proportion  to their  respective  amounts  of  accrued  and  unpaid
     dividends per share or liquidation  prices,  without preference or priority
     one over the other; and

          (iii) junior to the Series B Preferred Stock, as to dividends or as to
     the distribution of assets upon liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, if
     such  stock  shall be Common  Stock or Class B Stock or if the  holders  of
     Series B Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to receipt of  dividends  or of
     amounts  distributable upon liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, as the
     case may be, in  preference  or  priority  to the holders of shares of such
     stock.

     (8) Voting.  Except as herein  provided or as  otherwise  from time to time
required  by law,  holders  of Series B  Preferred  Stock  shall  have no voting
rights.  Whenever,  at any time or times,  dividends  payable  on the  shares of
Series B Preferred  Stock at the time  outstanding  shall be in arrears for such
number of Dividend  Periods,  which  Dividend  Periods need not be  consecutive,
which  shall in the  aggregate  contain  not less than 540 days,  the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right,  voting separately as a
class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of preferred  stock
ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends, or on the
distribution  of assets  upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up and upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are  exercisable,  to elect two
directors  of the  corporation  at the  corporation's  next  annual  meeting  of
stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections
for such directors, each holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
one vote for each  share  held (the  holders  of  shares of any other  series of
preferred stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes,
if any,  for each  share of stock  held as may be  granted  to  them).  Upon the
vesting of such right of the  holders of Series B Preferred  Stock,  the maximum
authorized  number of members of the Board of Directors shall  automatically  be
increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the
holders of outstanding  Series B Preferred  Stock (either alone or together with
the holders of shares of any one or more other series of preferred stock ranking
on such a parity and having like voting  rights) as hereinafter  set forth.  The
right of holders of Series B Preferred Stock,  voting  separately as a class, to
elect  (either  alone or together  with the holders of shares of any one or more

                                       18

<PAGE>

other series of preferred  stock ranking on such a parity and having like voting
rights) members of the Board of Directors as aforesaid shall continue until such
time as all dividends  accumulated  on Series B Preferred  Stock shall have been
paid in full, at which time such right shall  terminate,  except as herein or by
law  expressly  provided,  subject to  revesting  in the event of each and every
subsequent default of the character above mentioned.

     If the office of any director  elected by the holders of Series B Preferred
Stock,  voting as a class,  becomes  vacant  by  reason  of death,  resignation,
retirement,  disqualification or removal from office or otherwise, the remaining
director elected by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock,  voting as a class,
may choose a successor who shall hold office for the  unexpired  term in respect
of which such vacancy occurred. Upon any termination of the right of the holders
of Series B Preferred Stock to vote for directors as herein  provided,  the term
of office of all directors then in office  elected by Series B Preferred  Stock,
voting as a class, shall terminate  immediately.  Whenever the term of office of
the directors  elected by the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock,  voting as a
class, shall so terminate and the special voting powers vested in the holders of
Series B Preferred  Stock shall have expired,  the number of directors  shall be
such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws  irrespective  of any increase
made pursuant to the provisions of this Section (8).

     So long as any shares of the Series B Preferred  Stock remain  outstanding,
the  consent  of the  holders of at least  two-thirds  of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock  outstanding at the time given in person or by proxy,  either in
writing  or at any  special or annual  meeting,  shall be  necessary  to permit,
effect or validate any one or more of the following:

     (a)  The  authorization,  creation  or  issuance,  or any  increase  in the
authorized  or issued  amount,  of any class or series of stock ranking prior to
Series B Preferred  Stock as to  dividends  or the  distribution  of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or

     (b) The amendment,  alteration or repeal, whether by merger,  consolidation
or otherwise,  of any of the provisions of the Certificate of  Incorporation  of
the  corporation,  as amended,  which would  materially and adversely affect any
right,  preference or voting power of Series B Preferred Stock or of the holders
thereof;  provided,  however,  that any  increase  in the  amount of  authorized
preferred stock or the creation and issuance of other series of preferred stock,
or any  increase  in the amount of  authorized  shares of such  series or of any
other series of preferred stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior
to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be
deemed to materially  and adversely  affect such rights,  preferences  or voting
powers.

     The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would  otherwise be required  shall
be effected,  all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been
redeemed or sufficient  funds shall have been  deposited in trust to effect such
redemption, scheduled to be consummated within three months after such time.

     (9) Record  Holders.  The  corporation  and the Transfer Agent may deem and
treat the record  holder of any shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock as the true
and lawful owner thereof for all purposes,  and neither the  corporation nor the
Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

FIFTH. The amount of capital with which the corporation  will commence  business
is One Thousand Dollars ($1,000).

SIXTH. The corporation is to have perpetual existence.

SEVENTH.  The private property of the  stockholders  shall not be subject to the
payment of corporate debts to any extent whatever.

EIGHTH. The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business
and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation:

                                       19

                                   SECTION 1.

                        POWERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.


     1.1.  General.  In  furtherance,  and  not in  limitation,  of  the  powers
conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:

          (1) To make,  alter or repeal the By-Laws of the  corporation;  to set
     apart out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve
     or reserves for any proper purpose and to abolish the same in the manner in
     which it was created,  and to fix and  determine  and to vary the amount of
     the  working  capital  of  the  corporation;   to  determine  the  use  and
     disposition  of the working  capital and of any surplus or net profits over
     and above the capital of the corporation determined as provided by law, and
     to fix the times for the declaration and payment of dividends; to authorize
     and cause to be executed  mortgages and liens,  without limit as to amount,
     upon the real and  personal  property  of the  corporation;  and to fix and
     determine the fees and other  compensation to be paid by the corporation to
     its directors;

          (2) To determine from time to time whether and to what extent,  and at
     what times and  places,  and under what  conditions  and  regulations,  the
     accounts and books of the corporation (other than the stock ledger), or any
     of  them,  shall  be  open  to  inspection  of  the  stockholders;  and  no
     stockholder  shall have any right to inspect any account,  book or document
     of the corporation  except as conferred by statute,  unless authorized by a
     resolution of the stockholders or directors;

          (3) To  make  donations  for the  public  welfare  or for  charitable,
     scientific  or  educational  purposes;  and to  cause  the  corporation  to
     cooperate with other corporations or with natural persons, or to act alone,
     in  the  creation  and   maintenance  of  community  funds  or  charitable,
     scientific, or educational instrumentalities, and to make donations for the
     public welfare or for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes; and

          (4) To  designate,  by  resolution  passed by a majority of the entire
     Board, one or more committees,  each committee to consist of two or more of
     the  directors  of the  corporation,  which to the extent  provided  in the
     resolution  or in the  By-Laws  of the  corporation,  shall  have  and  may
     exercise  the powers of the Board of  Directors  in the  management  of the
     business and affairs of the corporation,  and may authorize the seal of the
     corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

     1.2. Powers Conferred by By-Laws. The corporation may in its By-Laws confer
powers upon its directors in addition to the  foregoing,  and in addition to the
powers and authorities expressly conferred upon them by the laws of the State of
Delaware.

                                   SECTION 2.

                          MEETING, OFFICERS AND BOOKS.

     If the By-Laws so provide,  the  stockholders  and the  directors  may hold
their meetings,  and the  corporation may have one or more offices,  outside the
State of Delaware.  The books of the  corporation  (subject to the provisions of
the laws of the State of Delaware)  may be kept outside of the State of Delaware
at such places as from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors.

                                      20

                                   SECTION 3.

                              VALIDITY OF CONTRACT.

     No contract,  transaction  or act of the  corporation  shall be affected or
invalidated by the fact that any of the directors of the  corporation are in any
wise  interested  in or  connected  with  any  other  party  to  such  contract,
transaction  or act or are themselves  parties to such contract,  transaction or
act,  provided that such interest shall be fully disclosed or otherwise known to
the Board of  Directors,  or a  majority  thereof,  at a meeting of the Board at
which such contract,  transaction  or act is authorized,  ratified or confirmed;
and any such director may be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at
any such meeting and may vote  thereat in  connection  with such  authorization,
ratification  or  confirmation  with like  force and effect as if he were not so
interested or connected or was not a party to such contract, transaction or act.

                                   SECTION 4.

                                  RATIFICATION.

     The  Board  of  Directors  in  its  discretion  may  submit  for  approval,
ratification  or  confirmation  by the  stockholders  at any meeting thereof any
contract,  transaction or act of the Board or of any officer,  agent or employee
of the corporation,  and any such contract,  transaction or act which shall have
been so  approved,  ratified or  confirmed  by the  holders of Common  Stock and
holders of Class B Stock, voting as provided in subsection 1.6 of Article FOURTH
hereof  shall  be as  valid  and  binding  upon  the  corporation  and  upon the
stockholders  thereof as though it had been  approved  and  ratified by each and
every stockholder of the corporation.


                                   SECTION 5.

      LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS; INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

     5.1.  Limitation on Liability of Directors.  A director of the  corporation
shall  not be  personally  liable to the  corporation  or its  stockholders  for
monetary  damages  for  breach  of  fiduciary  duty as a  director,  except  for
liability

          (i)  for  any  breach  of  the  director's  duty  of  loyalty  to  the
     corporation or its stockholders,

          (ii)  for  acts  or  omissions  not in good  faith  or  which  involve
     intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,

          (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or

          (iv) for any transaction  from which the director  derived an improper
     personal benefit.

     If the Delaware  General  Corporation  Law is amended after approval by the
stockholders  of this  subsection 5.1 of Article  EIGHTH to authorize  corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then
the liability of a director of the corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest  extent  permitted by the Delaware  General  Corporation  Law, as so
amended.

     5.2.  Effect of Any Repeal or Modification of Subsection 5.1. Any repeal or
modification of subsection 5.1 of this Article EIGHTH by the stockholders of the
corporation  shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

                                     21

     5.3. Indemnification and Insurance.

     5.3a. Right to  Indemnification.  Each person who was or is made a party or
is  threatened  to be made a party  to or is  involved  in any  action,  suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,  investigative or otherwise
(hereinafter a "proceeding"),  by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person
of whom he or she is the legal representative,  is or was a director, officer or
employee  of  the  corporation  or is or  was  serving  at  the  request  of the
corporation  as a director,  officer or employee of another  corporation or of a
partnership,  joint venture,  trust or other enterprise,  including service with
respect to  employee  benefit  plans,  whether the basis of such  proceeding  is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director,  officer or employee or in
any other  capacity while serving as a director,  officer or employee,  shall be
indemnified  and  held  harmless  by  the  corporation  to  the  fullest  extent
authorized by the Delaware  General  Corporation  Law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent
that such amendment  permits the corporation to provide broader  indemnification
rights  than  said  law  permitted  the  corporation  to  provide  prior to such
amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including penalties, fines,
judgments,  attorney's fees, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and excise
taxes or penalties  imposed on fiduciaries  with respect to (i) employee benefit
plans,  (ii)  charitable  organizations  or (iii)  similar  matters)  reasonably
incurred  or  suffered  by  such  person  in   connection   therewith  and  such
indemnification  shall  continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer  or  employee  and  shall  inure  to the  benefit  of his or her  heirs,
executors and  administrators;  provided,  however,  that the corporation  shall
indemnify  any  such  person  seeking   indemnification  in  connection  with  a
proceeding  (or part  thereof)  initiated by such person (other than pursuant to
subsection  5.3b of this  Article  EIGHTH)  only if  such  proceeding  (or  part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation.  The right
to indemnification  conferred in this subsection 5.3a of Article EIGHTH shall be
a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the  corporation  the
expenses  incurred  in  defending  any such  proceeding  in advance of its final
disposition;  provided,  however,  that if the Delaware General  Corporation Law
requires,  the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his
or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including
without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding  shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation
of an  undertaking,  by or on behalf of such  director or officer,  to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall  ultimately be determined  that such director or
officer is not entitled to be indemnified  under this subsection 5.3a of Article
EIGHTH or otherwise.

     5.3b.  Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim which the corporation is
obligated to pay under  subsection  5.3a of this  Article  EIGHTH is not paid in
full by the  corporation  within 60 days after a written claim has been received
by the  corporation,  the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the  corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part,  the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting  such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an
action  brought  to  enforce a claim for  expenses  incurred  in  defending  any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition  where the required  undertaking,
if any is required,  has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has
not met the  standards of conduct which make it  permissible  under the Delaware
General  Corporation  Law for the  corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
amount  claimed,  but  the  burden  of  proving  such  defense  shall  be on the
corporation.  Neither the  failure of the  corporation  (including  its Board of
Directors,  independent  legal  counsel  or its  stockholders)  to  have  made a
determination  prior to the commencement of such action that  indemnification of
the  claimant  is  proper  in the  circumstances  because  he or she has met the
applicable  standard of conduct set forth in the  Delaware  General  Corporation
Law, nor an actual  determination  by the  corporation  (including  its Board of
Directors,  independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has
not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption  that the claimant has not met the  applicable  standard of
conduct.

     5.3c.  Miscellaneous.  The provisions of this Section 5.3 of Article EIGHTH
shall cover claims, actions, suits and proceedings,  civil or criminal,  whether
now pending or hereafter  commenced,  and shall be  retroactive to cover acts or
omissions or alleged acts or omissions which heretofore have taken place. If any
part of this  Section  5.3 of  Article  EIGHTH  should be found to be invalid or

                               FORD MOTOR COMPANY

                       Executive Separation Allowance Plan

                      (As amended through December 18, 2000
                  for Separations on or after January 1, 1981)

     Section 1. Introductory.  This Plan has been established for the purpose of
providing  Leadership  Level One or Two Employees  with an Executive  Separation
Allowance  in the event of their  separation  from  employment  with the Company
under certain circumstances.  The Plan is an expression of the Company's present
policy with respect to separation  allowances  for  Leadership  Level One or Two
Employees who meet the  eligibility  requirements  set forth below;  it is not a
part of any  contract of  employment  and no employee or other person shall have
any legal or other  right to any  Executive  Separation  Allowance.  The Company
reserves the right to terminate,  amend or modify the Plan, in whole or in part,
at any time without notice.

     Section 2.  Eligibility.  Each Leadership  Level One or Two Employee who is
being separated from employment with the approval of the Company and who

     (1)  has at least five years'  service at the  Leadership  Level One or Two
          level, or its equivalent;

     (2)  has at least ten years of  contributory  membership  under the General
          Retirement Plan;

     (3)  is at least 55 years of age; and

     (4)  has applied for early retirement at the employee's option

shall be  eligible  to receive an  Executive  Separation  Allowance  as provided
herein.  The Eligible Surviving Spouse of a Leadership Level One or Two Employee
who (i) has not  separated  from  employment  with the  Company,  (ii) meets the
eligibility  conditions set forth in subsections (1) through (3) of this Section
2, and (iii) dies on or after  January 1, 1981 shall be  eligible to receive the
Executive  Separation Allowance that the Eligible Surviving Spouse of a deceased
employee would have been eligible to receive if such employee had separated from
employment  with the  approval  of the  Company  and  retired on the date of the
employee's death.

     The eligibility  conditions set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of Section
2 may be waived by the Chairman of the Board or the President except in the case
of a Leadership  Level One or Two Employee who has not separated from employment
with the Company.

     Section 3. Calculation of Amount.

     A. Base Monthly Salary. For purposes of the Plan, the "Base Monthly Salary"
of a  Leadership  Level One or Two  Employee  shall be the highest  monthly base
salary  rate of such  employee  during  the  employee's  12  months  of  service
immediately  preceding  separation from  employment  with the Company,  prior to
giving effect to any salary reduction  agreement pursuant to an employee benefit
plan,  as defined in Section  3(3) of the  Employee  Retirement  Security Act of
1974, as amended,  (i) to which Section 125 or Section 402(e)(3) of the Internal
Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended,  applies  or (ii)  which  provides  for the
elective   deferral  of   compensation.   It  shall  not  include   supplemental
compensation or any other kind of extra or additional compensation.

     B. Amount of Executive Separation  Allowance.  Subject to any limitation in
other  provisions  of the  Plan,  the  gross  monthly  amount  of the  Executive
Separation  Allowance of an Eligible  Leadership Level One or Two Employee under
Section 2 above shall be such  employee's  Base Monthly  Salary  multiplied by a
percentage,  not to exceed 60%, equal to the sum of (i) 15%, (ii) five tenths of
one percent (.5%) for each month (or fraction  thereof) that such employee's age
at separation  exceeds 55, not to exceed  thirty  percent  (30%),  and (iii) one
percent (1%) for each year of such employee's  service in excess of 15, prorated
for fractions of a year.

     The gross  amount for any month  shall be reduced by any  payments  paid or
payable for such month to the Eligible Leadership Level One or Two Employee, the
employee's surviving spouse,  contingent  annuitant,  or other beneficiary under
the General Retirement Plan or any other private retirement plan, other than the
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, to which the Company or its subsidiaries
shall have contributed.

     Section 4. Payments.  Executive Separation  Allowance payments,  in the net
amount  determined in accordance  with Section 3B above,  shall be made monthly.
Payments to an Eligible  Leadership Level One or Two Employee shall cease at the
end of the month in which such employee attains age 65 or dies, whichever occurs
first. In the event of death of an Eligible Leadership Level One or Two Employee
prior to such  employee  attaining  age 65, or in the event of death on or after
January  1,  1981 of a  Leadership  Level  One or Two  Employee  whose  Eligible
Surviving  Spouse meets the  eligibility  conditions  set forth in Section 2 for
payments hereunder, payments shall be made to such employee's Eligible Surviving
Spouse, if any, until the death of such spouse or, if earlier,  until the end of
the month in which the Leadership  Level One or Two Employee would have attained
age 65.

     Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the right of any
Eligible  Leadership  Level One or Two  Employee  to receive an  installment  of
Executive  Separation  Allowance  hereunder  for any month shall accrue only if,
during the entire period from the date of such employee's  separation to the end
of such  month,  such  employee  shall  have  earned  out  such  installment  by
refraining  from  engaging in any  activity  that is directly or

<PAGE>

                                       3

indirectly in  competition  with any activity of the Company or any Subsidiary
or Affiliate thereof.

     In the  event  of an  Eligible  Leadership  Level  One  or  Two  Employee's
nonfulfillment  of  the  condition  set  forth  in  the  immediately   preceding
paragraph,  no further  installment  shall be paid to such  employee;  provided,
however,  that the  nonfulfillment  of such  condition  may at any time (whether
before,  at  the  time  of  or  subsequent  to  termination  of  the  employee's
employment) be waived in the following manner:

     (1) with  respect  to any such  employee  who at any time shall have been a
member  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  a Vice  President,  the  Treasurer,  the
Controller  or the  Secretary of the Company,  such waiver may be granted by the
Compensation  and  Option  Committee  upon  its  determination  that in its sole
judgment  there  shall  have not been  and will not be any  substantial  adverse
effect upon the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate  thereof by reason of the
nonfulfillment of such condition; and

     (2) with respect to any other such employee,  such waiver may be granted by
the Annual Incentive  Compensation  Committee (or any committee  appointed by it
for the purpose) upon its  determination  that in its sole judgment  there shall
not have been and will not be any such substantial adverse effect.

     Anything  herein  contained  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  Executive
Separation Allowance payments shall not be paid to or with respect to any person
as to whom it has been  determined  that such person at any time (whether before
or subsequent to  termination of the  employee's  employment)  acted in a manner
inimical to the best interests of the Company.  Any such determination  shall be
made by (i) the Compensation and Option Committee with respect to any Leadership
Level  One  Employee  who at any time  shall  have been a member of the Board of
Directors,  an Executive Vice President,  a Vice President,  the Treasurer,  the
Controller  or the  Secretary  of the  Company,  and (ii) the  Annual  Incentive
Compensation  Committee  with respect to any other  Leadership  Level One or Two
Employee,  and  shall  apply  to any  amounts  payable  after  the  date  of the
applicable  Committee's  action hereunder,  regardless of whether the person has
commenced receiving Executive  Separation  Allowance.  Conduct which constitutes
engaging in an activity that is directly or indirectly in  competition  with any
activity of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof shall be governed
by the four immediately  preceding paragraphs of this Section 4 and shall not be
subject to any determination under this paragraph.

     Any Executive Separation Allowance payments resumed after reemployment with
the Company  under  Section 6A or  employment  with a Subsidiary  of the Company
under  Section 6B shall be paid on the basis of the  percentage  of Base Monthly
Salary applicable at the time of the initial determination under Section 3B.

     Section 5. Deductions. The Company may deduct from any payment of Executive
Separation  Allowance  to an Eligible  Leadership  Level 1 or 2 Employee or such
employee's

Eligible  Surviving  Spouse all  amounts  owing to it by such  employee  for any
reason, and all taxes required by law or government regulation to be deducted or
withheld.

     Section 6A. Person Reemployed by the Company.  In the event an employee who
shall have been separated from employment  with the Company under  circumstances
that would  make the  employee  eligible  to  receive  an  Executive  Separation
Allowance  shall be  reemployed  by the Company  before the employee  shall have
received  payment  of the full  amount of the  employee's  Executive  Separation
Allowance,   no  further   allowance   shall  be  paid  during  such  period  of
reemployment.

     Section 6B. Person  Employed by a Subsidiary.  In the event an employee who
shall have been separated from employment  with the Company under  circumstances
that would  make the  employee  eligible  to  receive  an  Executive  Separation
Allowance  shall be employed by a Subsidiary of the Company  before the employee
shall have  received  payment  of the full  amount of the  employee's  Executive
Separation  Allowance,  no further allowance shall be paid during such period of
employment.

Section 1. Purpose.

The purpose of this Plan is to preserve  certain benefits of employees under the
Company's tax qualified General Retirement Plan and Savings and Stock Investment
Plan for Salaried Employees by providing appropriate Equalization Benefits under
this Plan in place of benefits which cannot be provided under such tax qualified

As used in this Plan,  the following  terms shall have the  following  meanings,
respectively:

     2.01 "BEP Salary Reductions" shall mean that portion of salary at the basic
salary  rate which  would have been  credited to an  employee's  account  before
January 1, 1985 pursuant to a salary reduction  agreement under paragraph V-2 of
the  SSIP but  which by  reason  of  Section  4l5 of the  Code,  exceeds  salary
reduction  contributions that can be made by the Company on an employee's behalf
under the Tax-Efficient Savings Program of the SSIP.

     2.02 "Company" shall mean Ford Motor Company.

     2.03  "Committee"  shall mean the committee  authorized  to administer  and

Section 3. Equalization of Benefits.

     3.01 GRP Equalization Benefits.

          associated  with each  payment of a GRP benefit that is subject to the
          Limitations.

     (b)  The Periodic GRP Equalization  Benefit shall be equal in amount to the
          difference between the GRP benefit and the corresponding  benefit that
          would be payable under the GRP without regard to the  Limitations.  In
          determining the amount of the Periodic GRP Equalization  Benefit,  the
          member's  salary shall be the member's salary (as that term is defined
          in the GRP) plus BEP Salary  Reductions  for periods before January 1,
          1985  which  are  credited   under  this  Plan   pursuant  to  Section
          3.02(a)(ii)(C)  below,  but the  member  shall not make  contributions
          hereunder based on such BEP Salary Reductions.

          The Periodic GRP Equalization  Benefit shall be paid by the Company to
          the person receiving  payment of the corresponding GRP benefit and, as
          nearly as practicable, at the same time.

     (c)  As an  alternative  to the  GRP  Periodic  Equalization  Benefit,  the

          be determined by the Group Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
          the  Vice  President-General  Counsel  and  the  Vice  President-Human
          Resources:

          (i)  The actuarial  equivalent shall be determined on the basis of the
               interest rates and mortality  tables,  which would be used by the
               PBGC  for   determining   the  present  value  of  liability  for
               pensioners' benefits in the case of a terminated  retirement plan
               under  Title IV of ERISA  and  which  are in  effect in the month
               prior to the month when the employee's GRP benefit begins.

                    such pay period  (by a payroll  deduction  authorization  in
                    effect for such pay period  under  paragraph IV of the SSIP)

               withdrawals   pursuant  to  Section  3.02(a)(iv)  of  this  Plan;
               provided,  however,  that an  election  by a Company  officer  of
               investment  in Company  common  stock  shall not apply under this
               Plan  with   respect  to   contributions   pursuant   to  Section

               contributions)  which were made or  credited  hereunder  by or on
               behalf of such Company officer;  and the officer will be required
               to make any other investment  election  permitted under paragraph
               VIII of the SSIP with respect to such amounts.

          (iv) An  employee  may not  withdraw  any  amounts  in  excess  of the
               member's  regular savings  contributions  under this Plan and may
               not  borrow   against  the   subaccount   of  the  member's  SSIP
               Equalization Benefit.

          (v)  The SSIP Equalization Benefit under this Section 3.02(a) shall be
               equal to the amount at the time of  distribution  credited to the

               eligible employee's SSIP Equalization  Benefit under this Section

               which  would  have  been  made  under  the  SSIP  based  upon the
               employee's  SSIP  elections  except  that such  Company  matching
               contributions  cannot be made  because  of the  Limitations.  For
               periods  on or  after  October  1,  1995,  the  Company  Matching
               Contributions  shall  be made in the  form of  units  in the Ford
               Stock Fund rather than shares of Ford common stock.

          (ii) There  shall  be  established   for  each  eligible   employee  a
               subaccount  for  periods  of  participation  under  this  Section

               election by the member to transfer  the value of matured  Company
               matching contributions under paragraph 4.2 of the SSIP, as though
               credits to the member's account hereunder  had been so  invested.
               For periods May 1, 1996 and after, this subaccount shall be equal
               to the amounts credited by the Company

               basis of  investment  performance  attributable  to any  separate
               investment  election made by an eligible  employee  (other than a
               Company officer) on or after May 1, 1996. The investment  options
               for managing the subaccount  shall be identical to the investment
               options specified in Article VIII of the SSIP, although they will
               have separate fund codes.  Any BEP credits earned prior to May 1,
               1996  will  continue  to be  based on the  same  SSIP  investment
               elections used prior to May 1, 1996 unless the eligible  employee
               elects to  reallocate  or transfer all or part of the  subaccount
               balance among other  investment  options  available under Article
               XIII of the SSIP on or after May 1, 1996. Fidelity  Institutional
               Retirement  Services  Company  will  maintain  the  accounts  and
               process the  elections  and  otherwise be the  recordkeeper  with
               respect to this subaccount. Company officers with this subaccount
               are not  eligible to  reallocate  or transfer  credits  under the
               subaccount from the Ford Stock Fund to other investment  options,
               or from other investment options to the Ford Stock Fund.

          (iii)An employee  may not  withdraw  any amounts  credited  under this
               Section 3.02(b) and may not borrow against this subaccount of the
               member's SSIP  Equalization  Benefit.  This  subaccount  will not
               accept rollovers from other plans.

          (iv) The SSIP Equalization Benefit under this Section 3.02(b) shall be
               equal to the amount at the time of  distribution  credited to the
               employee's subaccount of the SSIP Benefit Equalization Account as
               determined under Section 3.02(b)(ii) above.

          (v)  In the  event  of  death  of an  eligible  employee  with an SSIP
               Benefit  Equalization  subaccount,  the balance of the subaccount
               shall be payable to the same beneficiary as the eligible employee
               has designated  under Article XIV of the SSIP unless the eligible
               employee makes a separate designation under this Plan pursuant to
               the rules established by the Compensation and Option Committee.

     (c)  Payment of SSIP Equalization Benefit.

          The SSIP Equalization  Benefit shall be paid in cash by the Company to
          the  employee,  or if the  employee  is  deceased,  to the  employee's
          beneficiary  under the SSIP,  and shall be made as soon as practicable
          after death, retirement or other termination of employment.

equivalent  (as  determined by an  independent  actuary  appointed by Ford Motor
Company) of the amount of the monthly  survivor's  benefit that would be payable
under the GRP, the ESAP,  the BEP,  and the SRP if all of the  Eligible  Retired
Executive's  years  of  service  under  the  GRP/ESAP/BEP/SRP  and  each  of the
subsidiary's  retirement  plans were  counted as years of  contributory  service
under the  GRP/ESAP/BEP/SRP  and (ii) is the  actuarial  equivalent  (under  the
method described in (i) above) of the amount of the monthly  survivor's  benefit
that is or was payable  under the  GRP/ESAP/BEP/SRP,  under Section 4.04 of this
Plan if the Designated  Beneficiary was an Eligible Surviving Spouse,  under the

               preceding the Retirement Effective Date;

               and (Y) is the GRP benefit  determined under the terms of the GRP
               in effect as of the  Retirement  Effective  Date,  regardless  of

               benefit redetermined under the terms of the GRP then in effect as

          Retirement  Effective  Date,  as  modified  by Section 4 of this Plan,

          giving effect to the following adjustments:

               Add three years to the Retired Executive's attained age as of the

          (X) is the ESAP  benefit  determined  under  the  terms of the ESAP in
          effect as of the Retirement  Effective Date after giving effect to the
          following adjustments:

               Add three years to the Retired Executive's attained age as of the
               Retirement Effective Date; and

               Add three  years of service to the Retired  Executive's  years of
               service as of the Retirement Effective Date;

          and (Y) is the ESAP benefit  calculated under the terms of the ESAP in
          effect as of the Retirement Effective Date.

          The ESAP Select Benefit determined as of the Retirement Effective Date
          shall  be an  amount  equal  to  at  least  a  fifteen  percent  (15%)
          improvement to the ESAP benefit determined under the terms of the ESAP
          in effect as of the Retirement Effective Date.

     5.04 DEP Select  Benefits.  The DEP Select Benefit  applicable to a Retired
          Executive who is otherwise  eligible for a DEP benefit under the terms
          of the DEP in effect as of the Retirement  Effective Date, shall be an
          amount  equal to the  difference  between (X) and (Y) where (X) is the
          DEP  benefit  determined  under the  terms of the DEP after  adjusting
          Final Average  Monthly  Salary as if the Retired  Executive had been a
          Contributing  member  and  received  Contributory  Service  for  three
          additional  years after the  Retirement  Effective Date at the Retired
          Executive's  Salary and (Y) is the DEP  benefit  determined  under the
          terms of the DEP in effect as of the Retirement Effective Date.

     Section  6  Administration   of  Select   Benefits.   Except  as  otherwise
specifically  provided in this Plan,  the Select  Benefits  attributable  to the
Retirement  Plans shall be  administered by the Company in the same manner as if
the Select Benefits were payable directly from such Retirement Plans. This means
that the underlying  eligibility  rules (except as modified by Section 4 of this
Plan), vesting rules, earning out provisions and survivorship  provisions of the
Retirement  Plans,  if  any,  shall  apply  to the  Select  Benefits  as if such
provisions were fully incorporated in this Plan.

     Section 7. Payments.  The Select Benefits  determined under Section 5 shall
be  payable  out  of the  Company's  general  funds  monthly,  beginning  on the
Retirement  Effective Date.  Payments to a Retired  Executive shall cease at the
end of the month in which the Retired Executive dies. Survivor benefits, if any,
payable under this Plan shall be determined  in accordance  with the  Retirement
Plans after giving effect to the adjustments described herein.

     Section 8. Reduction of Minimum Age Eligibility.

<PAGE>

                                       6

     8.01 Authority  to Reduce  Minimum  Age  Eligibility.  The Chief  Executive
          Officer of the Company shall have the authority,  from time to time in
          his or her sole and  absolute  discretion,  to reduce the  minimum age
          eligibility  specified  in Section  2.06(i) of the Plan from age 55 to
          age 52.

     8.02 Under  Age  55  Select  Benefits.  If an  Eligible  Executive  becomes
          eligible  to  receive a Select  Benefit  under this Plan  pursuant  to
          Section 8.01,  the Select  Benefits shall be calculated as provided in
          Sections 5 and 7 above. When a benefit becomes payable to the Eligible
          Executive  under  the  Retirement  Plans,  the  amount  of the  Select
          Benefits  shall be  reduced  by the  amounts  payable  from such other
          Retirement Plans.

     8.03 Subsidiary  Retirement  Plans.  If an Eligible  Executive under age 55
          would have become eligible for a regular early retirement benefit from
          a Subsidiary's retirement plan if he or she had remained in Subsidiary
          employment until the minimum age or service  eligibility  requirements
          under  such  Subsidiary's  plan  were  met,  this  Plan  shall pay the
          equivalent  Subsidiary early  retirement  benefit that otherwise would
          have been paid if the minimum eligibility requirements were met on the
          Retirement Effective Date. The payment shall cease at such time as the
          regular early retirement  benefit from the  Subsidiary's  plan becomes
          payable.  If the  Subsidiary's  plan shall pay only a deferred  vested
          benefit at age 55, the payment  shall  cease at death of the  Eligible
          Executive.  Survivor  benefits,  if any,  shall  cease at death of the
          Surviving  Spouse.  Any  payments  payable  under  this Plan  shall be
          reduced by the amount of the  deferred  vested or  survivor's  benefit
          payable under such Subsidiary's  plan. The amounts payable pursuant to
          this paragraph  shall be in addition to any other Select Benefits that
          otherwise may be payable under this Plan.

     Section 9. General Provisions.

     9.01 Plan  Administration  and  Interpretation.  The Vice President - Human
          Resources  and the Group Vice  President and Chief  Financial  Officer
          shall  have full  power and  authority  on  behalf of the  Company  to
          administer  and  interpret  the  Plan.  In the  event of a change in a
          designated  officer's  title,  the officer or officers with functional
          responsibility  for the  Retirement  Plans  shall  have the  power and
          authority to administer  and interpret  the Plan.  All decisions  with
          respect to the  administration and interpretation of the Plan shall be
          final and binding upon all persons.

     9.02 Deductions. The Company may deduct from any payment of Select Benefits
          to a  Retired  Executive  all  amounts  owing  to it by  such  Retired
          Executive for any reason,  and all taxes required by law or government
          regulation to be deducted or withheld.


     9.03 No Contract of Employment.  The Plan is an expression of the Company's
          present policy with respect to Eligible  Executives.  It is not a part
          of  any  contract  of  employment.  No  Eligible  Executive,   Retired
          Executive  or any other  person shall have any legal or other right to
          any Select Benefit.

<PAGE>

                                       7

     9.04 No Company Reemployment. A Retired Executive shall not be eligible for
          reemployment by the Company either  directly or indirectly  through an
          agency or otherwise.  This includes, but is not limited to, employment
          of a Retired  Executive  by the  Company as a  supplemental  employee,
          independent  contractor,  consultant,  advisor,  or  agency  employee,
          regardless of the length of employment. It also includes employment of
          a  Retired  Executive  by a sole  or  single  source  supplier  to the
          Company,  or  employment  by  any  supplier  of  the  Company  if  the
          responsibilities  of the Retired  Executive  relate  primarily  to the
          Company's business with the supplier, and are not merely incidental to
          the performance of the Retired  Executive's other job duties. A review
          panel consisting of at least two representatives  from Human Resources
          and one representative from the Office of the General Counsel shall be
          established to review Retired  Executive's  requests for reemployment.
          The  Retired   Executive  shall  furnish  to  the  Review  Panel  such
          information about the proposed  employment as is reasonably  requested
          to enable the Review Panel to evaluate  the request.  The Review Panel
          shall have sole and  absolute  discretion  to  determine  whether  the
          request for  reemployment  violates this  provision.  Decisions of the
          Review  Panel are final and binding on all parties and are not subject
          to further review.

          The  reemployment  condition may be waived by the Executive  Personnel
          Committee  (EPC) if the proposed  employment  advances  the  strategic
          interests of the Company or is otherwise  determined to be in the best
          interests of the Company.

          In the event a Retired  Executive  becomes  reemployed in violation of
          this provision without obtaining a waiver,  the EPC may suspend Select
          Benefits retroactively to the date of reemployment and recover amounts
          overpaid from the Retired Executive's  non-qualified benefits, if any,
          or any other source  permitted  by law.  The EPC also may  terminate a
          Retired Executive's future eligibility for Select Benefits or take any
          other action reasonably  necessary,  in the EPC's sole discretion,  to
          enforce the provisions of this Section.

     9.05 Select Benefits Not Funded. The Company's  obligations under this Plan
          are not funded.  Select Benefits under this Plan shall be payable only
          out of the general funds of the Company.

     9.06 Continuing  Plan.  The Plan shall be an ongoing Plan and shall be made
          available at the discretion of the Company.  The Company may designate
          certain  periods  within a  calendar  year in which  offers  of Select
          Benefits may be made and may provide that no offers of Select Benefits
          may be accepted  before or after  designated  dates  within a calendar
          year. The Company also may limit the offer of Select Benefits to those
          within a  designated  salary  roll or  band.  Select  Benefits  may be
          combined with  additional  types of  termination  incentives  upon the
          direction  of  the  Company.  Provisions  of  such  other  termination
          incentives are not governed by the terms of this Plan.

     9.07 Governing  Law.  Except as otherwise  provided  under federal law, the
          Plan and all  rights  thereunder  shall  be  governed,  construed  and
          administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.

     9.08 Amendment or Termination.  The Company reserves the right to modify or
          amend,  in whole or in part,  or to terminate  this Plan,  at any time
          without notice.

     9.09 Terms Not Otherwise  Defined.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
          in this Plan shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms under
          the applicable Retirement Plans.
